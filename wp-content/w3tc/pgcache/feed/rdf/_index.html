	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally done with the idea, I s&#8217;pose. The design concept is based in a problem of personal organization style: Given that one&#8217;s writing style will emerge and disrupt a design over time, how does one maintain connection between types of content? &#8212; My answer is a command-line-esque interface which listens for hypertext entries, littered over the page and strategically/thematically named. It&#8217;ll need polish, but nevertheless: This is <em title="That is: Tab and type in a link or something"><a href="http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net">A weedy florilegium</a> (try me out)</em>.</p>
<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>For type: I&#8217;m using a mix of <a href="http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=pigeon">Pigeon</a> from <a href="http://losttype.com/">losttype</a>, an Austin-based type co-op suggested by a dear friend, and <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Philosopher">Philosopher</a> from the <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a> library. The layout, constructed on <a href="http://960.gs/">960.gs</a>. Yes, yes, yes, <a title="W3 Total Cache, WP-DBManager, WP No Category Base, WP No Tags Base, Wordless, and some other junk. nginx is fast, ain't it?" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3">wordpress</a>. Repo here<a title="I'll fix it later... This PC is a POS. No fucking compiler works on this XP. Oh, and it's XP (the 90s car stereo of interoperability). Lost Ubuntu 11.10 root, so no root. Too lazy for the hazzle. I'm not even sure what I wanted to do with Dropbox anymore. Python is stupid everywhere but $HOME." href="https://github.com/nerdfiles/web-journal">.</a> &#8211;</p>
<p>I do not consider it <em>novel </em>by any stretch. I sat on the design of the toolbar long before finding the updated (12/2011) google.com toolbar hack. Of course, it&#8217;s pretty self-evident that commandline-based terminals aren&#8217;t new, only forgotten. I&#8217;ve only recently initiated myself in this world of mouse-less computing. And I believe it a skill only capable of exactness through experience, but at the cost of losing various modes of thinking which find source in habit and conclusion. I cannot be any less vague. But loss of linguistic form and grace is what it takes.</p>
<p>For color the color palette&#8230; What the #<a href="http://www.color-hex.com/color/fcf7f4">fck7f4</a>? I don&#8217;t see color.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tested in maybe <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/welcome.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">browsers</a><a href="http://www.opera.com/">?</a> Then again, I test on just about every device within smelling distance. Internet Explorer isn&#8217;t a browser. It&#8217;s an internet explorer. Its chief purpose is to enable unfettered bidirectional communication between you and the world. Every attempt at exploration has fundamentally changed the course of human-kind. How noble. The internet is a vast array of &#8212; I can&#8217;t do this&#8230; Get a real browser.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t like scrolling, go read a <a href="http://www.thereisnopagefold.com/">newspaper</a>.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Again, &#8216;thereof one must be silent.&#8217;</p>
<p>Where is this in <em>our aesthetic</em>? An aesthetic wherein a culture is no greater than its effects. Rooted in belief or by product of evolutionary narration, the explanation must concern itself with present existence of culture and the meaning such a fact holds with respect to it.</p>
<p>The possibility of privacy secures for one the foundation for happiness; but as yet, the genuine expression of silence is incapable where <em>the aesthetic </em>exists.</p>
<p>I confirm those in silence for its sake, or those who genuinely depend on it for survival. We live in an economy of silence underplayed.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The result is that we don’t seek reproductive success directly; we seek tasty foods that have tended to promote survival, and luscious mates who have tended to produce bright, healthy babies. The modern result? Fast food and pornography.<br />

<p>Some time ago I had a similar thought. It struck me after I found myself interested in autism, largely for personal reasons. Immediately it seems no less disconcerting to analytic philosophy, a tradition dogmatically rooted in a rejection of the historical mode (the dialectical passions of history). Thus, they must reject the propositions of history, but not that they are incapable of philosophical fruit, or even just assisting fostering it. Simply that it yields only anecdotal truth, something like relative truth. In any event, I&#8217;ve usually found it repugnant, philosophy, for this observation alone. &#8212; It seems an artificial meekness. The peripatetics will likely find root in any genuine context for the explorative passions.</p>
<p>With autism, the unclear idea may become clearer, the realization of a genetic safe-guard. Christians have an artificial safe-guard, their language; a principle of engineering abstinance, and at base, it is psychological. Their terms will refer for many years to come. Peripatetics, likewise, the mental obfuscation that language allows. Use in technology is inherently not philosophically interesting. Their <em>façan de parler</em> will be in tract. And really, how long can we go on with ignoring austistic claiming, for all intents and purposes, to be (aasimar)[<a href="http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html">http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html</a>]? Their language is above all the rest.<br />
If information wants to be free, at what cost? At what relevant cost? Want could information feasibly and conceivably damage in terms of the human phenotype, should its rate of production excessively make erratic the structure of the human condition? How can information be an enemy to us, a survival threat?</p>
<p>How much semantic, architectural, economic, ideological scaffolding does one find in an interface? And how widely, systematically, and reliably are these languages deployed?</p>
<p>As a child I never quite understood what the interface stood for. With legos, I developed everything. I&#8217;d learn the manuals, but after recurring parades of bedroom destruction, I would rebuild in my own language. While stepping through the manuals, I never would take the time to identify complexity. Every manual produced one construction. I saved the &#8220;learning of language&#8221; for my own creativity endeavoring in the Lego system. For years I did this, and I believe such practice instilled in me a capacity to reject interfaces. Let&#8217;s say, the notion of the Common (polite dinner talk, morality, religion, gods, voting, popular music, etc).</p>
<p>I often rarely _disagree_; but the grid is a bit off.</p>
<p>I’m quite sure I am even less capable now; but often &#8220;representation&#8221; becomes a topic in philosophy. The interface is a unique manifestation of actual representation. Even more abstract.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;iP address&#8221;? That&#8217;s something Steve Jobs did right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interesting part, however, is that the U.S. government, I think, is has (realized)[<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/2011/12/16/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works">http://motherboard.vice.com/2011/12/16/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works</a>] it too. A certain feature is required to address what Heidegger observes in &#8220;man&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Man is what lies at the bottom of all beings; and that is,<br />
in modern termsww, at the bottom of all objectification and<br />
representability.<br />
&#8211; Martin Heidegger, 1940</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike Judge, Steve Pemberton, and others have seen it. Soon our human phenotype must harmonize with the potential threats of alluring phenotype extension (now, as evolution would have it, between the technological mode of thought housed inside the human capability and the Semantic Web, a web which has internalized the framework development of the Analytics of the early 20th-century and the ordinary language professors, and dating back to the Latin with its prescriptive and proscriptive qualities, the basis of Cartesian thought, and on and on. The web is a systematic articulation of grammars: a complete distillation of power structure, and thus authority; the basis for understanding liberty, as they define each other &#8212; thus, the incompatibility of the Web and Governments). In object-oriented programming we allude to problems like this by saying things like &#8220;that object is too big,&#8221; namely suggesting that not only does it bear too much, but the complexity itself seems to imply only further complexity in certain undesirable ways. When interfacing with it, checking its properties, etc.</p>
<p>Often I hear people talking about computers, the Facebooks and Tumblrs and all, as if they&#8217;re natural events in one&#8217;s everyday life. But with Christians, autistics, philosophers, and certain other types, these computer events are less accidental and more intentional; Christians usually in reaction, autistics in production, philosophers in speculation (meta-production). But the common thread of humanity will simply yield, and the U.S. government hopes to manage the inevitable rupture to the status qua that the Web is now presenting. It is a human psychological-cognitive scalability issue, latent with ethical strictures and with an underpinning trajectory to preserve the common language, such that the Web&#8217;s rules for communication and privacy do not uplift what the U.S. government sees as protecting, protection of &#8220;We, the people&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the government cannot understand the objects of reference of its populace, it is no government. The Web and Government must pass over in silence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This, too, may be happening already. Christian and Muslim fundamentalists and anti-consumerism activists already understand exactly what the Great Temptation is, and how to avoid it. They insulate themselves from our creative-class dreamworlds and our EverQuest economics. They wait patiently for our fitness-faking narcissism to go extinct. Those practical-minded breeders will inherit the Earth as like-minded aliens may have inherited a few other planets. When they finally achieve contact, it will not be a meeting of novel-readers and game-players. It will be a meeting of dead-serious super-parents who congratulate each other on surviving not just the Bomb, but the Xbox.<br />

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Language is part of the human organism and is no less complicated than it.&#8221; &#8212; In language we find that expression never lacks an authority, chiefly, one for whom such expression entraps and fails to disclose. Nevertheless, authority orients meaning, the stuffness and &#8220;poignancy&#8221; therein, those words, dry as they are, the objects of reference.</p>
<p>But what is language, indeed? The stuff on the street, hidden behind my showering wall? I see it here before me, and littered grid-ly across my screen and driver&#8217;s side view. Perchance I should avoid such broad sweeping strokes of language? &#8212; Much of that ain&#8217;t language!</p>
<p>And yet the Web phenotype is lost. The extension of life, persistence, technically more divine, on abouts and in expression, than any religious doctrine or psalm. No text grants the doctrine of immortality, save the storehouses of the Web phenotype.</p>
<p>And soon, should it become medically relevant, as study wherein an age only real-time study is credible, morally and toward one&#8217;s economic sensibilities? I wish to understand the language I speak, and yet the Web is here, stifling it with immortality.</p>
<p>What kind of god is this? I imagine in me, this one needs for you to know my Web organism. And why shouldn&#8217;t you? Or I? What have I done? &#8212; Lacking any opinion from enframement and mechanics of browser &#8212; the perspective of forensics. A god that will let the linguistic phenotype exceed its parameters.</p>
<p>And what science demands to understand.</p>

<p>The b and i tags are still valid and have a measure of applicability. Please read the specification before you attempt to instruct others.</p>
<p>It shows a misunderstanding of the phrase &#8220;more semantic&#8221; when one says that &#8220;strong elements are more semantic than b elements.&#8221; Not only is this not the case, but it makes no sense for it to be the case. The applicability of b and applicability of strong are mutually exclusive. For one, it is obvious that strong has a connotation to represent on top of the text itself where as b has no connotation beyond stylistic marking. Style is the only property they share, while their uses determine their meaning. We don&#8217;t mean to only suggest, and nothing more, &#8220;this is italic text&#8221; or &#8220;this is bold text.&#8221; If the task were that simply, sure, we would have redundancy in the markup, and so on. But &#8220;more semantic&#8221; suggests a measure of applicability. So surely strict observance of the specification which describes the criteria for use, and key awareness of doctype, is markedly instrumental to discussion. Worth a shot, no?</p>
<p>Any mention of the linguistic markings which go on in academic literature, European, American, etc will easily attest to the major role of the b and i elements&#8217; and their meaning. Think of i as having an implicit meta-data taxonomization which may describe dialectic or historical data; we think this when identifying the Latin mid-sentence. In a web design context, think of b as the most basic textual representation of a &#8220;call to action.&#8221; b represents a kind of thingness on the page. One way to look at them is with fear, as a developer, due to the verb implication of b&#8217;s. They don&#8217;t have much to say linguistically, in terms of the content itself or otherwise, but they do shoot upwards the idea that the text itself, as a whole message, stands in a certain relation to the web page. b, then, seems to me, under the worst case scenario, like a UI hook.</p>
<p>Think of b as the &#8220;prompt&#8221; for inline elements.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well here&#8217;s a <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~alexanderpeden/FamilyTree2011/789.htm">find</a>.</p>
<p><a style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;" href="http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sanford-alexander.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2763" title="sanford-alexander" src="http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sanford-alexander.jpg" alt="" width="250" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Sanford Alexander Sr. was born a slave in South Carolina in 1823. His exact arrival in Sandtown Community in Neshoba County near the Bogue Chitto Community is not known. He was purchased at a slave market in New Orleans, Louisiana, by the Alexander family and brought to this area. Sanford was freed in 1865 in Neshoba County, Mississippi, at the age of 42. He lived 64 years as a free man in Neshoba and Kemper Counties. Sanford was the father of 10 children from two marriages, this expanded the Alexander name for over six generations.</p>
<p>Sanford was a successful farmer who acquired several hundred acres of land. The offspring of this former slave are productive citizens who are proud of their heritage. His grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren are successful lawyers, doctors, corporate managers, computer programmers, pilots, professional football players, cattle ranchers, insurance agents, underwriters, educators and entrepreneurs. He died in 1929 at the age of 106.</p>
<p>Sanford was buried in the Liberty United Methodist Church Cemetery in Collinsville, Mississippi. His grandson, the late Kutcher Threefoot Alexander, Sr., purchased a memorial headstone for his grave. Kutcher Threefoot Alexander found and preserved a portrait of our great-grandfather.</p>
<p>Sanford was married to Charlotte and Mandy. His children are: Mary Alexander Polluck, Mike Alexander, Frank Alexander, Daughty Alexander McClain, Miles Alexander, Lewis Alexander (father of Kutcher), Jerry Alexander, John Alexander, Maranda Alexander Donald and Mary Louise &#8220;Lou&#8221; Alexander Hall.</p>
