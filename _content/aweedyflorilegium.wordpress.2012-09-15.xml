		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The entertainment system was belting out the Beatles’ “We Can Work It Out” when the phone rang. When Pete answered, his phone turned the sound down by sending a message to all the other local devices that had a volume control. His sister, Lucy, was on the line from the doctor’s office: “Mom needs to see a specialist and then has to have a series of physical therapy sessions. Biweekly or something. I’m going to have my agent set up the appointments.” Pete immediately agreed to share the chauffeuring.

At the doctor’s office, Lucy instructed her Semantic Web agent through her handheld Web browser. The agent promptly retrieved information about Mom’sprescribed treatment from the doctor’s agent, looked up several lists of providers, and checked for the ones in-plan for Mom’s insurance within a 20-mile radius of her home and with a rating of excellent or very good on trusted rating services. It then began trying to find a match between available appointment times (supplied by the agents of individual providers through their Web sites) and Pete’s and Lucy’s busy schedules. (The emphasized keywords indicate terms whose semantics, or meaning, were defined for the agent through the Semantic Web.)

In a few minutes the agent presented them with a plan. Pete didn’t like it¿University Hospital was all the way across town from Mom’s place, and he’d be driving back in the middle of rush hour. He set his own agent to redo the search with stricter preferences about location and time. Lucy’s agent, having complete trust in Pete’s agent in the context of the present task, automatically assisted by supplying access certificates and shortcuts to the data it had already sorted through.

Almost instantly the new plan was presented: a much closer clinic and earlier times¿but there were two warning notes. First, Pete would have to reschedule a couple of his less important appointments. He checked what they were¿not a problem. The other was something about the insurance company’s list failing to include this provider under physical therapists: “Service type and insurance plan status securely verified by other means,” the agent reassured him. “(Details?)”

Lucy registered her assent at about the same moment Pete was muttering, “Spare me the details,” and it was all set. (Of course, Pete couldn’t resist the details and later that night had his agent explain how it had found that provider even though it wasn’t on the proper list.)
Expressing Meaning
Pete and Lucy could use their agents to carry out all these tasks thanks not to the World Wide Web of today but rather the Semantic Web that it will evolve into tomorrow. Most of the Web’s content today is designed for humans to read, not for computer programs to manipulate meaningfully. Computers can adeptly parse Web pages for layout and routine processing¿here a header, there a link to another page¿but in general, computers have no reliable way to process the semantics: this is the home page of the Hartman and Strauss Physio Clinic, this link goes to Dr. Hartman’s curriculum vitae.

The Semantic Web will bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages, creating an environment where software agents roaming from page to page can readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users. Such an agent coming to the clinic’s Web page will know not just that the page has keywords such as “treatment, medicine, physical, therapy” (as might be encoded today) but also that Dr. Hartman works at this clinic on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and that the script takes a date range in yyyy-mm-dd format and returns appointment times. And it will “know” all this without needing artificial intelligence on the scale of 2001?s Hal or Star Wars’s C-3PO. Instead these semantics were encoded into the Web page when the clinic’s office manager (who never took Comp Sci 101) massaged it into shape using off-the-shelf software for writing Semantic Web pages along with resources listed on the Physical Therapy Association’s site.

The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. The first steps in weaving the Semantic Web into the structure of the existing Web are already under way. In the near future, these developments will usher in significant new functionality as machines become much better able to process and “understand” the data that they merely display at present.

The essential property of the World Wide Web is its universality. The power of a hypertext link is that “anything can link to anything.” Web technology, therefore, must not discriminate between the scribbled draft and the polished performance, between commercial and academic information, or among cultures, languages, media and so on. Information varies along many axes. One of these is the difference between information produced primarily for human consumption and that produced mainly for machines. At one end of the scale we have everything from the five-second TV commercial to poetry. At the other end we have databases, programs and sensor output. To date, the Web has developed most rapidly as a medium of documents for people rather than for data and information that can be processed automatically. The Semantic Web aims to make up for this.

Like the Internet, the Semantic Web will be as decentralized as possible. Such Web-like systems generate a lot of excitement at every level, from major corporation to individual user, and provide benefits that are hard or impossible to predict in advance. Decentralization requires compromises: the Web had to throw away the ideal of total consistency of all of its interconnections, ushering in the infamous message “Error 404: Not Found” but allowing unchecked exponential growth.
Knowledge Representation
For the semantic web to function, computers must have access to structured collections of information and sets of inference rules that they can use to conduct automated reasoning. Artificial-intelligence researchers have studied such systems since long before the Web was developed. Knowledge representation, as this technology is often called, is currently in a state comparable to that of hypertext before the advent of the Web: it is clearly a good idea, and some very nice demonstrations exist, but it has not yet changed the world. It contains the seeds of important applications, but to realize its full potential it must be linked into a single global system.

Traditional knowledge-representation systems typically have been centralized, requiring everyone to share exactly the same definition of common concepts such as “parent” or “vehicle.” But central control is stifling, and increasing the size and scope of such a system rapidly becomes unmanageable.

Moreover, these systems usually carefully limit the questions that can be asked so that the computer can answer reliably¿ or answer at all. The problem is reminiscent of G¿del’s theorem from mathematics: any system that is complex enough to be useful also encompasses unanswerable questions, much like sophisticated versions of the basic paradox “This sentence is false.” To avoid such problems, traditional knowledge-representation systems generally each had their own narrow and idiosyncratic set of rules for making inferences about their data. For example, a genealogy system, acting on a database of family trees, might include the rule “a wife of an uncle is an aunt.” Even if the data could be transferred from one system to another, the rules, existing in a completely different form, usually could not.

Semantic Web researchers, in contrast, accept that paradoxes and unanswerable questions are a price that must be paid to achieve versatility. We make the language for the rules as expressive as needed to allow the Web to reason as widely as desired. This philosophy is similar to that of the conventional Web: early in the Web’s development, detractors pointed out that it could never be a well-organized library; without a central database and tree structure, one would never be sure of finding everything. They were right. But the expressive power of the system made vast amounts of information available, and search engines (which would have seemed quite impractical a decade ago) now produce remarkably complete indices of a lot of the material out there. The challenge of the Semantic Web, therefore, is to provide a language that expresses both data and rules for reasoning about the data and that allows rules from any existing knowledge-representation system to be exported onto the Web.

Adding logic to the Web¿the means to use rules to make inferences, choose courses of action and answer questions¿is the task before the Semantic Web community at the moment. A mixture of mathematical and engineering decisions complicate this task. The logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. Fortunately, a large majority of the information we want to express is along the lines of “a hex-head bolt is a type of machine bolt,” which is readily written in existing languages with a little extra vocabulary.

Two important technologies for developing the Semantic Web are already in place: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). XML lets everyone create their own tags¿hidden labels such as or that annotate Web pages or sections of text on a page. Scripts, or programs, can make use of these tags in sophisticated ways, but the script writer has to know what the page writer uses each tag for. In short, XML allows users to add arbitrary structure to their documents but says nothing about what the structures mean.

 



The Semantic Web will enable machines to COMPREHEND semantic documents and data, not human speech and writings.



Meaning is expressed by RDF, which encodes it in sets of triples, each triple being rather like the subject, verb and object of an elementary sentence. These triples can be written using XML tags. In RDF, a document makes assertions that particular things (people, Web pages or whatever) have properties (such as “is a sister of,” “is the author of”) with certain values (another person, another Web page). This structure turns out to be a natural way to describe the vast majority of the data processed by machines. Subject and object are each identified by a Universal Resource Identifier (URI), just as used in a link on a Web page. (URLs, Uniform Resource Locators, are the most common type of URI.) The verbs are also identified by URIs, which enables anyone to define a new concept, a new verb, just by defining a URI for it somewhere on the Web.

Human language thrives when using the same term to mean somewhat different things, but automation does not. Imagine that I hire a clown messenger service to deliver balloons to my customers on their birthdays. Unfortunately, the service transfers the addresses from my database to its database, not knowing that the “addresses” in mine are where bills are sent and that many of them are post office boxes. My hired clowns end up entertaining a number of postal workers¿not necessarily a bad thing but certainly not the intended effect. Using a different URI for each specific concept solves that problem. An address that is a mailing address can be distinguished from one that is a street address, and both can be distinguished from an address that is a speech.

The triples of RDF form webs of information about related things. Because RDF uses URIs to encode this information in a document, the URIs ensure that concepts are not just words in a document but are tied to a unique definition that everyone can find on the Web. For example, imagine that we have access to a variety of databases with information about people, including their addresses. If we want to find people living in a specific zip code, we need to know which fields in each database represent names and which represent zip codes. RDF can specify that “(field 5 in database A) (is a field of type) (zip code),” using URIs rather than phrases for each term.
Ontologies
Of course, this is not the end of the story, because two databases may use different identifiers for what is in fact the same concept, such as zip code. A program that wants to compare or combine information across the two databases has to know that these two terms are being used to mean the same thing. Ideally, the program must have a way to discover such common meanings for whatever databases it encounters.

A solution to this problem is provided by the third basic component of the Semantic Web, collections of information called ontologies. In philosophy, an ontology is a theory about the nature of existence, of what types of things exist; ontology as a discipline studies such theories. Artificial-intelligence and Web researchers have co-opted the term for their own jargon, and for them an ontology is a document or file that formally defines the relations among terms. The most typical kind of ontology for the Web has a taxonomy and a set of inference rules.

The taxonomy defines classes of objects and relations among them. For example, an address may be defined as a type of location, andcity codes may be defined to apply only to locations, and so on. Classes, subclasses and relations among entities are a very powerful tool for Web use. We can express a large number of relations among entities by assigning properties to classes and allowing subclasses to inherit such properties. If city codes must be of type city and cities generally have Web sites, we can discuss the Web site associated with a city code even if no database links a city code directly to a Web site.

Inference rules in ontologies supply further power. An ontology may express the rule “If a city code is associated with a state code, and an address uses that city code, then that address has the associated state code.” A program could then readily deduce, for instance, that a Cornell University address, being in Ithaca, must be in New York State, which is in the U.S., and therefore should be formatted to U.S. standards. The computer doesn’t truly “understand” any of this information, but it can now manipulate the terms much more effectively in ways that are useful and meaningful to the human user.

With ontology pages on the Web, solutions to terminology (and other) problems begin to emerge. The meaning of terms or XML codes used on a Web page can be defined by pointers from the page to an ontology. Of course, the same problems as before now arise if I point to an ontology that defines addresses as containing a zip code and you point to one that uses postal code. This kind of confusion can be resolved if ontologies (or other Web services) provide equivalence relations: one or both of our ontologies may contain the information that my zip code is equivalent to your postal code.

Our scheme for sending in the clowns to entertain my customers is partially solved when the two databases point to different definitions of address. The program, using distinct URIs for different concepts of address, will not confuse them and in fact will need to discover that the concepts are related at all. The program could then use a service that takes a list of postal addresses (defined in the first ontology) and converts it into a list of physical addresses (the second ontology) by recognizing and removing post office boxes and other unsuitable addresses. The structure and semantics provided by ontologies make it easier for an entrepreneur to provide such a service and can make its use completely transparent.

Ontologies can enhance the functioning of the Web in many ways. They can be used in a simple fashion to improve the accuracy of Web searches¿the search program can look for only those pages that refer to a precise concept instead of all the ones using ambiguous keywords. More advanced applications will use ontologies to relate the information on a page to the associated knowledge structures and inference rules. An example of a page marked up for such use is online at http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hendler. If you send your Web browser to that page, you will see the normal Web page entitled “Dr. James A. Hendler.” As a human, you can readily find the link to a short biographical note and read there that Hendler received his Ph.D. from Brown University. A computer program trying to find such information, however, would have to be very complex to guess that this information might be in a biography and to understand the English language used there.

For computers, the page is linked to an ontology page that defines information about computer science departments. For instance, professors work at universities and they generally have doctorates. Further markup on the page (not displayed by the typical Web browser) uses the ontology’s concepts to specify that Hendler received his Ph.D. from the entity described at the URI http://www. brown.edu ¿ the Web page for Brown. Computers can also find that Hendler is a member of a particular research project, has a particular e-mail address, and so on. All that information is readily processed by a computer and could be used to answer queries (such as where Dr. Hendler received his degree) that currently would require a human to sift through the content of various pages turned up by a search engine.

In addition, this markup makes it much easier to develop programs that can tackle complicated questions whose answers do not reside on a single Web page. Suppose you wish to find the Ms. Cook you met at a trade conference last year. You don’t remember her first name, but you remember that she worked for one of your clients and that her son was a student at your alma mater. An intelligent search program can sift through all the pages of people whose name is “Cook” (sidestepping all the pages relating to cooks, cooking, the Cook Islands and so forth), find the ones that mention working for a company that’s on your list of clients and follow links to Web pages of their children to track down if any are in school at the right place.
Agents
The real power of the Semantic Web will be realized when people create many programs that collect Web content from diverse sources, process the information and exchange the results with other programs. The effectiveness of such software agents will increase exponentially as more machine-readable Web content and automated services (including other agents) become available. The Semantic Web promotes this synergy: even agents that were not expressly designed to work together can transfer data among themselves when the data come with semantics.

An important facet of agents’ functioning will be the exchange of “proofs” written in the Semantic Web’s unifying language (the language that expresses logical inferences made using rules and information such as those specified by ontologies). For example, suppose Ms. Cook’s contact information has been located by an online service, and to your great surprise it places her in Johannesburg. Naturally, you want to check this, so your computer asks the service for a proof of its answer, which it promptly provides by translating its internal reasoning into the Semantic Web’s unifying language. An inference engine in your computer readily verifies that this Ms. Cook indeed matches the one you were seeking, and it can show you the relevant Web pages if you still have doubts. Although they are still far from plumbing the depths of the Semantic Web’s potential, some programs can already exchange proofs in this way, using the current preliminary versions of the unifying language.

Another vital feature will be digital signatures, which are encrypted blocks of data that computers and agents can use to verify that the attached information has been provided by a specific trusted source. You want to be quite sure that a statement sent to your accounting program that you owe money to an online retailer is not a forgery generated by the computer-savvy teenager next door. Agents should be skeptical of assertions that they read on the Semantic Web until they have checked the sources of information. (We wish more people would learn to do this on the Web as it is!)

Many automated Web-based services already exist without semantics, but other programs such as agents have no way to locate one that will perform a specific function. This process, called service discovery, can happen only when there is a common language to describe a service in a way that lets other agents “understand” both the function offered and how to take advantage of it. Services and agents can advertise their function by, for example, depositing such descriptions in directories analogous to the Yellow Pages.

Some low-level service-discovery schemes are currently available, such as Microsoft’s Universal Plug and Play, which focuses on connecting different types of devices, and Sun Microsystems’s Jini, which aims to connect services. These initiatives, however, attack the problem at a structural or syntactic level and rely heavily on standardization of a predetermined set of functionality descriptions. Standardization can only go so far, because we can’t anticipate all possible future needs.

 



Properly designed, the Semantic Web can assist the evolution of human knowledge as a whole.



The Semantic Web, in contrast, is more flexible. The consumer and producer agents can reach a shared understanding by exchanging ontologies, which provide the vocabulary needed for discussion. Agents can even “bootstrap” new reasoning capabilities when they discover new ontologies. Semantics also makes it easier to take advantage of a service that only partially matches a request.

A typical process will involve the creation of a “value chain” in which subassemblies of information are passed from one agent to another, each one “adding value,” to construct the final product requested by the end user. Make no mistake: to create complicated value chains automatically on demand, some agents will exploit artificial-intelligence technologies in addition to the Semantic Web. But the Semantic Web will provide the foundations and the framework to make such technologies more feasible.

Putting all these features together results in the abilities exhibited by Pete’s and Lucy’s agents in the scenario that opened this article. Their agents would have delegated the task in piecemeal fashion to other services and agents discovered through service advertisements. For example, they could have used a trusted service to take a list of providers and determine which of them are in-plan for a specified insurance plan and course of treatment. The list of providers would have been supplied by another search service, et cetera. These activities formed chains in which a large amount of data distributed across the Web (and almost worthless in that form) was progressively reduced to the small amount of data of high value to Pete and Lucy¿a plan of appointments to fit their schedules and other requirements.

In the next step, the Semantic Web will break out of the virtual realm and extend into our physical world. URIs can point to anything, including physical entities, which means we can use the RDF language to describe devices such as cell phones and TVs. Such devices can advertise their functionality¿what they can do and how they are controlled¿much like software agents. Being much more flexible than low-level schemes such as Universal Plug and Play, such a semantic approach opens up a world of exciting possibilities.

For instance, what today is called home automation requires careful configuration for appliances to work together. Semantic descriptions of device capabilities and functionality will let us achieve such automation with minimal human intervention. A trivial example occurs when Pete answers his phone and the stereo sound is turned down. Instead of having to program each specific appliance, he could program such a function once and for all to cover every local device that advertises having a volume control ¿ the TV, the DVD player and even the media players on the laptop that he brought home from work this one evening.

The first concrete steps have already been taken in this area, with work on developing a standard for describing functional capabilities of devices (such as screen sizes) and user preferences. Built on RDF, this standard is called Composite Capability/Preference Profile (CC/PP). Initially it will let cell phones and other nonstandard Web clients describe their characteristics so that Web content can be tailored for them on the fly. Later, when we add the full versatility of languages for handling ontologies and logic, devices could automatically seek out and employ services and other devices for added information or functionality. It is not hard to imagine your Web-enabled microwave oven consulting the frozen-food manufacturer’s Web site for optimal cooking parameters.
Evolution of Knowledge
The semantic web is not “merely” the tool for conducting individual tasks that we have discussed so far. In addition, if properly designed, the Semantic Web can assist the evolution of human knowledge as a whole.

Human endeavor is caught in an eternal tension between the effectiveness of small groups acting independently and the need to mesh with the wider community. A small group can innovate rapidly and efficiently, but this produces a subculture whose concepts are not understood by others. Coordinating actions across a large group, however, is painfully slow and takes an enormous amount of communication. The world works across the spectrum between these extremes, with a tendency to start small¿from the personal idea¿and move toward a wider understanding over time.

An essential process is the joining together of subcultures when a wider common language is needed. Often two groups independently develop very similar concepts, and describing the relation between them brings great benefits. Like a Finnish-English dictionary, or a weights-and-measures conversion table, the relations allow communication and collaboration even when the commonality of concept has not (yet) led to a commonality of terms.

The Semantic Web, in naming every concept simply by a URI, lets anyone express new concepts that they invent with minimal effort. Its unifying logical language will enable these concepts to be progressively linked into a universal Web. This structure will open up the knowledge and workings of humankind to meaningful analysis by software agents, providing a new class of tools by which we can live, work and learn together.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Arguments against its usage:
(1) Concealed and underlining dormant homophobia in society.
(2) An example expressing one's poor vocabulary.

Arguments for its usage:
(1) Everyone else says it. It's become so popular.
(2) Mature homosexuals and lesbians are now comfortable with it.

I don't feel the "dormant homophobia" argument is valid. But the "poor vocabulary" argument is strong and conducive to getting this popularity of the umbrella term "gay" removed. 

I feel our opinions, worldviews, philosophies, etc. are conflicting enough. We will progress better if our language is as inoffensive as possible. So if you know someone is offended by your habitual use of the umbrella term "gay," you should make it a habit to restrain yourself from using it to play it safe. Eventually, you won't find yourself using it anymore. If you're only saying it because society has influenced you so, the word has no sentimental value or actual personal meaning for you. So why defend its usage? You have no reason to fight for it, so just use some prudence and expand your vocabulary.

If you are gay&mdash;"mature" or not&mdash;, you should not be content with someone using "gay" as a marker for that which they find disdainful or inconvenient. Language is the most powerful tool for the expression of our reason, and although no single word bears any inherent Truth [but only a representation for our penchant for their use], it serves as a detriment to human progress to allow words to scar your fellow man or woman. If you enjoy beauty and good things, you should strive so that your language too can be beautiful and good [as you see it]. You must ask yourself: Do I see beauty and utility in my usage of the term "gay" or equally divisive terms? If not, and their usage can be imagined to bring about distress, subtract the usage of that term.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Can a metaphysical paradox be resolved with an appeal to an epistemological concept or solution? Would it not be commission of a fallacy to <em>assume </em>human ignorance in so far as your intellectual limit is established but simultaneously assume you have even stumbled upon a metaphysical riddle that bears definitions you have <em>adequately </em>comprehended?

You cannot both maintain that those definitive components to riddles are intelligible to you while at the same time appealing to your own ignorance of those riddles' proposed answers. You must reject the entire argument on principle that its definitions themselves are unintelligible (unattainable by human reason). If you do not and still yet contend that their solutions are false while their definitions (or premises) proper, you have in actuality yet to understand the components of the question itself. It produces a self-defeating debate between the epistemologist and the metaphysician. Therefore, you must assume the question has components which are intelligible to you and bear adequate definitions before you can claim that attempts to resolve them have failed.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>1 Human Web Developer</h2>
<a href="http://profiles.google.com/nerdfiles">I</a> am a <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/07/26/defending-the-generalists-in-the-web-design-industry/" target="_blank">Generalist</a> Web Developer and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/alphabet" target="_blank">Standardista</a>, currently taking on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and front-end Web development at <a href="http://pennebaker.com">Pennebaker</a>. For the most part I am a systems thinker: as a designer, I deal in systems of interactive and non-interactive content, verbal and non-verbal content, graphical and typographical content, logical organizations of content, accessibility to content, usability barriers to content, dynamic and static content, higher order forms of content (types, categorization, taxonomy, labeling, content mapping, sorting, etc) as information contexts; as a developer, in much similar fashion, I draft code to mitigate <em>technical debt as a</em> <em>holistic problem</em> of user interface development.

My passion for Web development ranges from <a href="http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/the-problems-of-ui-development-part-one-and-class-itis/" target="_blank">exploring</a> the technical limits and philosophical moorings of the <a href="http://tantek.com/2010/281/b1/what-is-the-open-web" target="_blank">Open</a> and <a href="http://infomesh.net/2001/swintro/" target="_blank">Semantic</a> Web movements to

<h2>2 Anarchist</h2>
I am a self-describ'd "structural" or "analytical" anarchist, which I believe closely resembles JC Lester's "<a href="http://www.la-articles.org.uk/otteson.htm" target="_blank">critical-rationalist libertarianism</a>"; often call'd "private-property anarchism" (that is, "property-based" <em>as opposed to</em> "rights-based", or morality-based, anarchism) or, more rarely, yet nevertheless historically-root'd in, "anarchistic socialism" in academic circles and "<a href="http://www.la-articles.org.uk/libertarianism_intro.pdf" target="_blank">libertarianism</a>" in<em>politeia</em>-company.

I have genuinely believed and defend'd Proudhon's assertion <a href="http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/proudhon/sp001863.html" target="_blank">property is theft!</a>; as yet find infinite entertainment in the <a href="http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/enee.html" target="_blank">Ego</a> while occasionally entertaining Marxist <a href="http://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/p/a.htm" target="_blank">history</a> and <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/voloshinov/1929/marxism-language.htm" target="_blank">theorizing</a>; more concretely, I believe that the current U.S. government (late 2011, at the time of this writing) is a manifestation of what I call a "representative <a href="http://www.la-articles.org.uk/pc.htm" target="_blank">ochlocracy</a>".
<h3>2.1 Basic Concept</h3>
<blockquote>"Anarchism does not repudiate the right of ownership, but it has a conception thereof sufficiently different from Mr. Bilgram's to include the possibility of an end of that social organization which will arise, not out of the ruins of government, but out of the transformation of government into voluntary association for defence."
<cite>— Reply to Hugo Bilgram</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>"If the men who oppose wages - that is, the purchase and sale of labor - were capable of analyzing their thought and feelings, they would see that what really excites their anger is not the fact that labor is bought and sold, but the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labor, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labor by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labor, and that, but for the privilege, would be enjoyed by all gratuitously. And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege, the class that now enjoy it will be forced to sell their labor, and then, when there will be nothing but labor with which to buy labor, the distinction between wage-payers and wage-receivers will be wiped out, and every man will be a laborer exchanging with fellow-laborers. Not to abolish wages, but to make every man dependent upon wages and secure to every man his whole wages is the aim of Anarchistic Socialism. What Anarchistic Socialism aims to abolish is usury. It does not want to deprive labor of its reward; it wants to deprive capital of its reward. It does not hold that labor should not be sold; it holds that capital should not be hired at usury."
<cite>— Benjamin R. Tucker, <em>Individual Liberty: Selections From the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker</em></cite></blockquote>

<h2>3 Student of Philosophy</h2>
I am culturally, economically, historically and intellectually indebted to the West and its history of ideas. These moorings are indeed critically important, I feel, in a time of rapid technological growth, ideological and cultural fragmentation, flagrant novelty, authoritarian decentralization and globalization such a trade prepares one for the onslaught of media absurdity, (anti-)religious brow-beating and dogmatism, rampant reductionism, scientism, conceptual confusion, intolerably bald-faced consequentialist and technological modes of thinking, and the eerie prophetic rhythms of Greek kyklos.(Of course, this isn't to say that one cannot both be a utilitarian and a "philosopher," even by the letter.)
<h3>3.1 Academic</h3>
My academic background, strictly speaking, is color'd by a <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/From-Technologist-to/128231/" target="_blank">rite of passage</a> through the guile and wit of the standard fare training in analytic philosophy. I earn'd my BA in Philosophy at University of Houston, one of the dryer of the schools in the United States, historically given from and to formal systems thinking, logic, ordinary language philosophy, pragmatism, atheism, post-analytic thought, naturalism, with strong touches of the early modern, Greek, and feminist strains.
<h3>3.2 Personal</h3>
My <a href="http://www.uh.edu/class/philosophy/" target="_blank">strict studies</a> are accompanied by personal philosophical investment in the pre-Socratics, ancient Stoicism, <a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/f_spinoza.html" target="_blank">Baruch Spinoza</a>, Spinozism and various topics in Early Modern thought, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/" target="_blank">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, later <a href="http://cfh.ufsc.br/~mafkfil/pears.htm" target="_blank">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, Marxism and <a href="http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/h/i.htm#historical-materialism" target="_blank">historical materialism</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R15MKLF1GO2XHZ/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R15MKLF1GO2XHZ" target="_blank">Alain Badiou</a>, Gettier-style <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~ujanel/Gettier.htm" target="_blank">problems</a>, epistemologies, the <a href="http://xkcd.com/903/" target="_blank">mind-body problem</a>, practical and global/<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/" target="_blank">philosophical</a> skepticism, <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/web/can/cannibalism.html" target="_blank">cannibalism</a>, <a href="http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica" target="_blank">meta-ethics</a>, Kantian ethics, <a href="http://www.ditext.com/hare/lm.html" target="_blank">prescriptivism</a>, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/africana/" target="_blank">africana</a> and african diaspora, <a href="http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/singer05.htm" target="_blank">philosophical vegetarianism</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cxYFw3NkPMoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">philosophy of science</a>, <a href="http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/contents_PhiloFndtns_Neurosci.pdf" target="_blank">philosophy of neuroscience</a> and <a href="http://www.pineforge.com/upm-data/6031_Chapter_10_O%27Brien_I_Proof_5.pdf" target="_blank">psychology</a>, <a href="http://www.roangelo.net/logwitt/#Preface" target="_blank">philosophy of language</a>, <a href="http://www.class.uh.edu/phil/garson/Jim_Garson.htm" target="_blank">logic</a>, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-mathematics/" target="_blank">Finitism</a>, mereology, <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jksadegh/A%20Good%20Atheist%20Secularist%20Skeptical%20Book%20Collection/George%20H.%20Smith%20-%20Atheism-%20The%20Case%20Against%20God%20%28v1.1%29.pdf" target="_blank">atheism</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441" target="_blank">computer</a> <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/online-preface.html" target="_blank">hacking</a> and the necessarily <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Called-Thinking-Martin-Heidegger/dp/006090528X" target="_blank">existentialist</a>, yet fortunately sometimes phenomenological, ruptures which come with <em>living through</em> a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/" target="_blank">technological age</a>.

<h2>5 Musician</h2>
<strong> </strong>Over the past couple of years I have come to wholly appreciate whatever noise I can produce from the <a href="http://soundcloud.com/nerdfiles" target="_blank">guitar</a>. The principle of style I use to guide me seems similar to the likes of <a href="http://www.johnfahey.com/" target="_blank">John Fahey</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Rose_%28guitarist%29" target="_blank">Jack Rose</a>, but I would never rank myself among their stock as musicians. My efforts are simple-minded attempts at rhythmic atonality, dissonance, silence and repetition.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A collection of quotations. For style, clarity, poignancy, rarity, etc. Tuning the juxtaposition is my perennial project.
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-large; color: #c0c0c0;">§</span></p>

<blockquote>As long as I am nothing but a ghost of the civil dead, I can do nothing...
<cite>— Jack Henry Abbott</cite>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Anti-aging therapies will] never be perfect, but we’ll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of before we have any 200-year-olds, and the same for 300 and 400 and so on.
<cite>— Aubrey de Grey</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>If, during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life, organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organization, and I think this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to the high geometric powers of increase of each species, at some age, season or year, a severe struggle for life, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence, causing an infinite variety in structure, constitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, I think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each being’s own welfare, in the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterized will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterized. This principle of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection.
<cite>— Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species (1859)</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.
<cite>— H.L. Mencken</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>It is not for nothing that one has been a philologist, perhaps one is a philologist still, that is to say, a teacher of slow reading.
<cite>— Friedrich Nietzsche</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Besides, we are friends of the lento, I and my book. I have not been a philologist in vain — perhaps I am one yet: a teacher of slow reading. I even come to write slowly. At present it is not only my habit, but even my taste — a perverted taste, maybe — to write nothing but what will drive to despair every one who is ‘in a hurry.’ For philology is that venerable art which exacts from its followers one thing above all — to step to one side, to leave themselves spare moments, to grow silent, to become slow — the leisurely art of the goldsmith applied to language: an art which must carry out slow, fine work, and attains nothing if not lento. Thus philology is now more desirable than ever before; thus it is the highest attraction and incitement in an age of ‘work’: that is, of haste, of unseemly and immoderate hurry-skurry, which is so eager to ‘get things done’ at once, even every book, whether old or new. Philology itself, perhaps, will not so hurriedly ‘get things done.’ It teaches how to read well, that is, slowly, profoundly, attentively, prudently, with inner thoughts, with the mental doors ajar, with delicate fingers and eyes. My patient friends, this book appeals only to perfect readers and philologists: learn to read me well!
<cite>— Friedrich Nietzsche</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.
<cite>-- Gloria Steinem</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Don't work. Avoid telling the truth. Be hated. Love someone.
--<cite> Adrian Tan, author of The Teenage Textbook (1988)</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>If you always tell the truth, you never need to remember what you say.
<cite>— Mark Twain</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>A new word is like a fresh seed sewn on the ground of discussion.

<cite>— L.W.</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>An expert is a person who has found out by his own painful experience all the mistakes that one can make in a very narrow field.

<cite>— Niels Bohr</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Fascism is capitalism unmasked.

<cite>— <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht" target="_blank">Bertolt Brecht</a></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Today, when the human being has come to be seen as 'the sum of all social circumstances' the epic form is the only one that can embrace those processes which serve the drama as matter for a comprehensive picture of the world. Similarly man, flesh and blood man, can only be embraced through those processes by which and in the course of which he exists.

<cite>— <em>Brecht on Theatre.</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht" target="_blank">Bertolt Brecht</a>.</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.

<cite>— Thomas Jefferson</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>I asked him if he would come up with a few options. And he said, "No. I will solve your problem for you. And you will pay me. And you don’t have to use the solution. If you want options, go talk to other people. But I'll solve your problem for you the best way I know how. And you use it or not. That’s up to you. You’re the client. But you pay me." And there was a clarity about the relationship that was refreshing.

<cite>— Steve Jobs on working with designer Paul Rand on the NeXT logo</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature.<cite>— Niels Bohr</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.
<cite>— James Miles <small>(Having had his arm mutilated, making immediate amputation necessary, he loaded and discharged his piece with one hand and urged his men forward; this within 30 yards of the enemy's works.)</small></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
<cite>— Gary Provost</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Congress is about to pass internet censorship, even though the vast majority of Americans are opposed. We need to kill the bill - PIPA in the Senate and SOPA in the House - to protect our rights to free speech, privacy, and prosperity.
!

<cite>— http://americancensorship.org/</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.
<cite>— "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace", John Perry Barlow</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly. But the traitor moves among those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the galleys, heard in the very hall of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor – he speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and wears their face and their garment, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation – he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city – he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared.
<cite>— Cicero, 42 B.C.</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>The first thing I do in the morning is brush my teeth and sharpen my tongue.

<cite>— Dorothy Parker</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>He who lives as children live — who does not struggle for his bread and does not believe that his actions possess any ultimate significance — remains childlike.

<cite>— Nietzsche, <em>Daybreak</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>If I don't kill him he'll make war all through Europe. But murder... the most foul of all crimes. What would Socrates say? All those Greeks were homosexuals. Boy, they must have had some wild parties. I bet they all took a house together in Crete for the summer. A: Socrates is a man. B: All men are mortal. C: All men are Socrates. That means all men are homosexuals. Heh... I'm not a homosexual. Once, some cossacks whistled at me. I happen to have the kind of body that excites both persuasions. You know, some men are heterosexual and some men are bisexual and some men don't think about sex at all, you know... they become lawyers.

<cite>— Boris, <em>Love and Death</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Thou hast remembered me, O God; neither hast thou forsaken them that seek Thee and love Thee.

<cite>— Daniel (Daniel's Prelude to the Dreaming)</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.

<cite>— Book of Daniel, 5:5-6</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
<div><cite>(Proverbs 25/11)</cite></div></blockquote>
<blockquote>Let’s suppose every night that you were able to dream any dream that you wanted to dream. And that you could, for example, have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time or any length of time you wanted to have. And you would naturally, as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes, you would have every kind of pleasure you could conceive, and after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each, you would say well that was pretty great, but now lets um, lets have a surprise. Let’s have a dream that isn’t under control. Well, something is going to happen to me that I don’t know what it’s going to be. And uh, you would dig that and you would come out of that and say well that was a close shave wasn’t it, and then you would get more and more adventurous, and make further and further out gambles and finally you would dream where you are now. You would dream the dream of the life you are actually living today.
<cite>— Alan Watts</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>He who does not understand your silence will probably not understand your words.
<cite>— Elbert Hubbard</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>With the rise of democracy, the identification of the State with society has been redoubled, until it is common to hear sentiments expressed which violate virtually every tenet of reason and common sense: such as ‘we are the government.’
<cite>— Murray N. Rothbard, “The Anatomy of the State”</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>The thesis that I support does not in any way declare that being is mathematical, which is to say composed of mathematical objectivities. It is not a thesis about the world but about discourse. It affirms that mathematics, throughout the entirety of its historical becoming, pronounces what is expressible of being qua being.
<cite>— Alain Badiou, <em>Being and Event</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>So be prepared for a bit of hard talking. It won’t kill you, and it may advance your understanding.
<cite>— Ian Ravenscroft, "How to Be a Philosopher"</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality.
<cite>— Edgar Allen Poe</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Words are loneliness.
<cite>— Henry Miller</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Wovon man nicht sprechen kann darüber muß man schweigen.
<cite>— L.W.</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>More generally, a ‘thing’ will be defined as a certain series of aspects, namely those which would commonly be said to be of the thing. To say that a certain aspect is an aspect of a certain thing will merely mean that it is one of those which, taken serially, are the thing.
<cite> — Russell, Our Knowledge of the External World, 1914a, 106–107</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>The unfitness of the object may cause one to overlook the unfitness of the means.
<cite>— Kafka</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Everyone carries a room about inside them. This fact can be proved by means of the sense of hearing. If someone walks fast and one pricks up one's ears, say at night, when everything round about is quiet, one hears, for instance, the rattling of a mirror not quite firmly fastened to the wall.
<cite>— Kafka</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>In a certain sense, infinite divisibility means that space is indivisible, that it is not affected by any division. That it is above such things: it doesn’t consist of parts. Much as if it were saying to reality: you may do what you like in me (you can be divided as often as you like in me.) Space gives to reality an infinite opportunity for division.
<cite>— LW</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Perchance you who pronounce my sentence are in greater fear than I who receive it.
<cite>— Giordano Bruno</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>I cleave the heavens, and soar to the infinite. What others see from afar, I leave far behind me.
<cite>— Giordano Bruno</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>And the true philosophers are always occupied in the practice of dying, wherefore also to them least of all men is death terrible.
<cite>— Socrates, Phaedo</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Prove all things. Hold fast to that which is good.
<cite>— First Thessalonians 5:21</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it tries to raise doubts where no questions can be asked. For doubt only can exist where a question exists, a question only where an answer exists, and an answer only where something can be said.
<cite>— TLP, Wittgenstein</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Obviously, no one would freely choose to become a philosopher - they are, <em>unfortunately</em>, born that way.
<cite>— Steven Colbert (?)</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>5.1362 The freedom of the will consists in the impossibility of knowing actions that still lie in the future. We could know them only if causality were an <em>inner</em> necessity like that of logical inference. The connexion between knowledge and what is known is that of logical necessity. ('<em>A</em> knows that <em>p</em> is the case', has no sense if <em>p</em> is a tautology.)
<cite>— Wittgenstein, <em>Tractatus</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>A mathematician is bound to be horrified by my mathematical comments, since he has always been trained to avoid indulging in thoughts and doubts of the kind I develop. He has learned to regard them as something contemptible and… he has acquired a revulsion from them as infantile. That is to say, I trot out all the problems that a child learning arithmetic, etc., finds difficult, the problems that education represses without solving. I say to those repressed doubts: you are quite correct, go on asking, demand clarification!
<cite>— Wittgenstein, <em>PG 381</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>4.003 Most propositions and questions, that have been written about on philosophical matters are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language. ( They are of the kind of question whether the Good is more or less identical to the Beautiful. ) And it is not surprising that the deepest problems are in fact not problems at all.
<cite>— Wittgenstein, <em>TLP</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>In philosophy matters are not simple enough for us to say 'Let's get a rough idea,' for we do not know the country except by knowing the connections between the roads. So I suggest repetition as a means of surveying the connections.
<cite>— Wittgenstein</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upwards.
<cite>— Book of Job</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Distrust of grammar is the first requisite of philosophizing.
<cite>— Wittgenstein, <em>Notebooks</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.
<cite>— Wittgenstein</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Where questions of style and exposition are concerned I try to follow a simple maxim: if you can't say it clearly you don't understand it yourself.
<cite>— John Searle</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>We all inherit a great deal of useless knowledge, and a great deal of misinformation and error (maps that were formerly thought to be accurate), so that there is always a portion of what we have been told that must be discarded. But the cultural heritage of our civilization that is transmitted to us -- our socially pooled knowledge, both scientific and humane -- has been valued principally because we have believed that it gives us accurate maps of experience. The analogy of verbal words to maps is an important one [...]. It should be noticed at this point, however, that there are two ways of getting false maps of the world into our heads: first, by having them given to us; second, by creating them ourselves when we misread the true maps given to us.
<cite>— S. Hayakawa, <em>Language in Thought and Action</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>A person of true refinement would have expressed much of that very differently, but nothing will ever make up for the lack of a classical education.
<cite>— Ernest Bramah, <em>Kai Long Unrolls His Mat </em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>It has always been the prerogative of children and half-wits to point out that the emperor has no clothes. But the half-wit remains a half-wit, and the emperor remains an emperor.
<cite>— Neil Gaiman, <em>Sandman</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>What power would Hell have if those imprisoned there were not able to dream of Heaven?
<cite>— Neil Gaiman, <em>Sandman</em></cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Your car is Japanese. Your vodka is Russian. Your pizza is Italian. Your kebab is Turkish. Your democracy is Greek. Your coffee is Colombian. Your movies are American. Your tea is Tamil. Your shirt is Indian. Your oil is Saudi Arabian. Your electronics are Chinese. Your numbers - Arabic, your letters - Latin. And you complain that your neighbor is an immigrant? [...]
<cite>— Unknown</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>The presumption of understanding everything can have no other basis than never understanding anything. For anyone who had experienced just once the perfect understanding of one single thing and had truly tasted how knowledge is earned would recognize that infinity of other truths of which he understands nothing.
<cite>— Galileo Galilei</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>In chess, the object of the game is clear, the rules are fixed and indisputable, and there is always a definite outcome (win, lose, or draw) about which no controversy can arise. In philosophy, the object and the rules are themselves part of what is in play, and there is never an incontrovertible result.

So I need both of these gifts of the gods. Chess to recuperate from the uncertainty of philosophy, and philosophy to recuperate from the sterility of chess.

<blockquote>Given that we do not have an omniscient god's-eye view of the universe, we cannot, in principle, perceive the truth of universal propositions such as ‘All Swans are white' (where that includes all past, present and future swans). Neither could any finite number of observations of white swans (even if they could be guaranteed to be accurate, which they cannot) add any strength to the universal theory that they are all white: for the observations are, ex hypothesi, an infinitely small number relative to the universal theory. So we cannot even make our theories more probable (except on the basis of assumptionsconjectures about probability that cannot be shown to be independently probable). However, says Popper, nil desperandum. There is an asymmetry between verification and falsification. We could, in principle (though we might always be mistaken), perceive a single non-white swan. And if we in fact (as a matter of reality) do so then that fact would, as a logical implication, falsify the theory that all swans are white.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Caveat: This needs serious work. Perhaps I will revise these "claims", without doing too much damage to their thrust, in 10 years (or tomorrow). My other philosophical ramblings are <a title="Philosophical notes" href="/topics/philosophy/">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Note:</em> The ordering may be painfully off. Read with caution. I'm not exactly sure how unorder'd lists got in.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-large; color: #c0c0c0;">§</span></p>
1. A poem is a collection of misunderstood lines which jostle for attention like children at a party. The noisome distraction is the rest of the page.

2. When I rest there comes my best philosophizing. But I am unsure whether these were nightmares.

3. The religious man has everything to fear from his kin and nothing from the atheist. When will be the day that <em>we</em> pity the atheist?

4. I have several thoughts which rush at me during the day-to-day; I cannot determine which of them are philosophical and which of them are sorrows.

5. They confuse us with Philosophers. It matters indeed what we call things.

6. "Solve this puzzle. Now this. Now that." The <em>puzzle </em>is why I <em>must </em> use quotes.

7. Religion as a lifeless body of propositions. Perhaps our first step is a fallacy.

8. "Mind your matters." The neuroscientist is at war with a harmless idiom. It was rightly said that science has no other more significant, underpinning principle.

9. Science knows no better enemy than simplicity.

10. The <em>only </em>proof is that I stand here before you.

11. Write with a seriousness about you, one that is convincing. That is your best argument, and it carries with it all that it will need.

12. Morality has a logical form, one of which I have a knack for ignoring before all others.

13. We must admit that our problem is difficult before we can admit that we have a problem. Admittance is a rare talent.

14. I've always wondered which <em>box </em>they're talking about.

15. Let's argue over which adjective is best to use.

16. The Supreme Normative Principle of Morality: Make it seem as if you are making <em>argument</em>. When you read a Classic, look for the trick.

17. The philosopher becomes a social anthropologist. "You've shed light on your model, your methodology, not on the problem, for I have rejected that there is a problem. This is a philosophical background check. It began when you introduced your first normative claim."

18. The concept of "intellectual property" (and more generally, perhaps, "property") is a remnant of superstition and is highly religious in character. It is a manifestation of the capitalist's belief in life after death, a commonality with the spiritual or the religious. When X dies, the statement "X owns Y" remains true--a rather oddity. Which other similarities can we expose, between law and religion, capitalism and religion?

19. Our anachronistic tendency is perhaps justified. Too often am I mistaken for a historian.

20. The pessimist: Performance is a <em>good </em>indication of competence.
The behaviorist: Performance is the <em>only </em>indication of competence.

21. I frequently get the eerie feeling that the <em>locutions </em>are my <em>terms</em>.

22. A question is valid only under a certain setting.

23. Proof is unnecessary if rule calls for its self-evidence.

24. By "complex" we mean high up, and by "simple" we mean what is plain. Truth is all about moving across the smoothest plane <em>imaginable</em>.

25. When it comes down to it, ridicule is the easiest but most illuminating refutation. Track the line of ridicule, and you shall witness the history of ideas properly.

26. The habit of theory building. So too must the rest of me be of equal importance, from toe to the trembling before my reflection.

27. A gaze becomes vacant once a thought enters.

28. <em>Ne jamais sortez du lit avant midi.</em>

29. Game Show Ethics. There must be an absurdity in Socrates' method writ large.

30. The dialectic is an excuse for being ignorant. We cannot stop the convergence of games.

31. Concision is concession when in solitude. On the other hand--outward, it is understood that at a certain point we must learn to be precise. Precision is the gauge on which we judge one another. No higher respect can be paid to a philosopher. Though, I still lack the tools to spot a flagrant gloss.

32. We cannot be naive in our treatment of language-games. Their content is worthy of no respect by us, but their form is captivating.

33. Lights are eyesores on the night.

34. ?x(Sbx?-Sxx)--there's something Aristotelian about it. A denial of the logical type "humanity," to speak in those Russellian terms. To go further: A symbolism can have no meaning, a logic no content. But even further, the problem concerns the constitution of a rule. A role, a function, one dimensional procedure, linear, definition. Give the barber a "pure" character within the game, and we shall forget that he is organic.

35. Nihilists walk amongst us. The determining ground for faith is one's capacity to accept coincidence. How might this <em>capacity </em>demonstrate itself publicly.

36. As philosophers it becomes instinct to reject the mythical noun, or <em>it should be instinct. </em>Its precondition takes the count-noun, given an indeterminate quantity. At a certain point, the mythical noun creeps into the grammar of the culture by way of shorthand or decadence or self-taught limit or perhaps pity for the Self; then <em>predication of it becomes grammatical by mere use. </em>The point is then reached where we can call it a convention of that culture.

37. The distinction between<em> religious behavior</em> and <em>moral behavior</em>. He looks religious, but looks at the same time immoral. Does religious behavior imply moral properties at all?

38. A child at a church service or at the playground looks to his parent and asks <em>that </em>kind of question. The parent dismisses the child's inquiry as nonsense, infantile philosophizing or timewasting. The parent simply has not the energy to devote to such a line of inquiry which <em>obviously </em>misapplies terms while a sincerity looms. The child wishes to be answered appropriately. What is the appropriate response? What is the child <em>truly </em>after?--The child, in learning and growing, is drowned in a waterfall of terms, phrase, idiom, metaphor, analogy, <em>facon de parler</em>, jargon, modal expressions of (superficially) incommensurable language games, poetic license, and so forth. Imagine a community in which the language employed by its members is in every respect similar to your own, but only the vocabulary has been shifted slightly. "Tree" refers to something other than is the norm with respect to your language, "House" to something other, and so on. How might you go about learning the language with sincerity and child-like energy? At what point will the members of that community call you a "skeptic"? Will you, in effect, find yourself engaging in metaphysical questions? Questioning the ontology of that community? Or will you merely find it perplexing that so many terms have shifted? You will say, "Look, look, I have begun this categorization procedure. I think I am quite on the right track. All these nouns are related thus, all these verbs fall under the same general case." But then someone will, by happenstance, suggest a new noun which is peculiar to the rest, outside of simply being novel to you. Then many persons will do the same with such a noun, and you will seek to understand why the noun is used in such a way while not used in others. Your child-like questioning will then appear like a thesis or a position <em>about </em>the things in question. Your questioning will appear ontological in nature, for it will be presumed, after some time, that you have some mastery of the language. But at what point have you become <em>master? </em>What does it mean to call you this? So for a child, is the child seeking guidance for a position? Is the child seeking instruction on some doctrine? Correct of his doctrine? Or is the child merely confused about the nature of so many nouns and phrase, seeking guidance as to why one noun fits while another does not? Is the child inquiring, or is the child a constraint for that which counts as grammatical? But the adult may use expression and phrase similar to the child; the adult's proposition may be construed as a question about the use of a term.

39. "Well, if we all agree about it, won't it be true? (I cannot accept someone else's testimony, because it is not <em>testimony</em>. It only tells me what he is <em>inclined </em>to say.)" (LW) My emphasis. Now consider religious testimony, scientific... Under a system, how might I distinguish the significant proposition from the determined proposition? How might I justify that there is a distinction to be had at all? What about when significant propositions between systems overlap, intrude, infiltrate? Philosophy is not a game unto itself, and neither is any other discourse. But my conception of this or that discourse delimits my propensity to say, "Ah, yes, that is a profound consideration. A profound idea indeed!"

40. A friend N. tells me, "But sometimes my language is insufficient; it does not harness the thought I wish to convey." To which I replied, "But is language the culprit?" "Not solely the culprit, no." But what should he wish to say. <em>Do we have a dilemma or not?</em>

41. My conscience informs me of my values thus... Are these orders? <em>Imperatives</em>? How might I order myself?--"Remember <em>your </em>values." That is, recall how you typically <em>behave</em>.

42. "I wish to tell you..." But you cannot know what is to be known unless caused by my words in the right way. How might you know nevertheless?

43. We tend to intuit the "intuition" of the other.

44. If morality has a grammar, then surely I could learn it, more or less; but why should I? A different issue: "Surely I <em>should </em>learn it." And now we face a new perspective. Our question takes on a new antagonism: a duality of what it means to be a "learner."

45. If I question you at all, might you consider me to be questioning you<em> in a particular way</em>? No question has a character of its own; every question is at the same time a presumption. "Might the behavior be so?"--"You question the principles of our method!" "Might I do it later?"--"You question the principles of my standard!" "Could I follow you thus?"--"But we have a determined plan." We could construe any conception, any volitional posture, as a principle from which one acts; but cynicism comes in the presumption of there being not principle to impose one's self. No principle is an immobile fortress, though it is embedded.

46. We say of the 'amoralist': he is nothing more than your posit with which to bother the foundations of home. The presumption is that amoralism exists only in the classroom setting. What a convenient presumption! It takes much legwork to get to a fair and even footing.

47. Ridicule is an art form and the greatest intellectual achievement. Surprising is it that it should not be listed amongst the greatest features of immorality; but it flies unscathed while we target "murder," "injustice," "atheism"...

48. We should wish to say not that the neuroscientist is false in his claim, but that he cannot possibly wish to mean what his utterance implies. A mistake into senselessness. A mistake often unseen. The illusion of sense is predicated on the illusion of grammaticality. If only to be grammatical were the extent of our purpose, but it is funny that they should reduce sense and significant assertion to be sufficiently made by grammaticality alone. The moralist claims, "Obey the law!" To which one replies, "But it <em>is </em>legal!"

49. It is a proposition, or a set of, which can intelligibly be said to be absolutist or Platonist or realist; while it may be said that this man or that woman that they are convicted or dogmatic or, in a particular sense, naïve. The former may be said or held in conjunction truly or falsely, while the latter may simply not. Where, and under which circumstances or conditions, might we see the mistake of mixing these categories, where a juggernaut conviction is mistaken for an absolutist position? Where a naïve question is painted before one's mind as unnecessarily one of naïve realism?

50. To accept, and fully understand, the private language argument is to follow an instinct; and to not is to not have that instinct.

51. The Philosopher asks, "Is that beauty, that aesthetic value contained, as it were, within the piece (this piece or that work or that sculpture) objective?" The denizen of the street might find this question peculiar in that it seems prima facie that this term "objective" has been let off its leash. But that is not the only problem, for the Grammarian notes what the street intimates: "There is a relation between the terms 'objective' and 'beauty'. Objective, to be fair, is a kind of abstract quality that a thing may have, but a quality (in a strong sense, the Philosopher's sense) nevertheless. And note, so too is "beauty," though an abstract quality but only w/r/t, say, a particular texture of a brush stroke. (One says, that brush stroke is beautiful--something more abstract in relation to crude strokes or nevertheless precise, trained pen, for "beauty" on most accounts intimates the belief that the "organization" in which the stroke or line inheres makes the stroke or line the complex, representational, symbolic move that it is. "Ah yes, that part of the artwork (the whole) is symbolic. So too, the work is itself, as a whole, symbolic; but there is a relation between these two symbols." Does the former constitute the latter?) But as abstracts concepts, "beauty" and "objective" seem to be at odds. Nevertheless the Philosopher plays her trick: "Is beauty objective?" (Notice the distinction between this question and our original, now the similarities. Are there <em>any</em> to speak of?) But we as Grammarians attempt a significance: "Look, if we both understand what is meant to be said by 'such-and-such is beautiful', then it must be understand that I cannot answer affirmatively to the original question. By 'beauty' I permit that it could not have been beautiful. To be beautiful is to be so in virtue of the non-objective presentation of that which I judge; little needs to be said that its constitution is <em>essentially </em>contingent." So might the latter Philosophical question be asked at all? Whether beauty be a Form or a inter-subjective standard, a convention, the question is clearly ill-formed, for no one buys the Forms (my argument is that I nudge you and ask, "Do you really believe that? Eh? Eh?--whatever your Platonic bearings and conception or rendition be) and surely to presume a meaning by convention presuppositions the answer which is to be sought by the Philosopher. But what is the philosopher indeed doing? Clearly if all he wishes to do is play with symbols in the Possibly Most Abstract, a nightmarish logic ensures: The worst kind of nightmare is one which consists of no pictures, no sensibility, no sensation, for pictures, images, with meaning, give the nightmare its life. But a "nightmare" professedly claimed by some patron--perhaps God--that consists of no imagery, nothing graphical? A blurry nightmare is at least a blur; we might say "at least it was just a blur" or "yes, the blur frightens me so." But a void nightmare with no leaning to the positive or the negative is the worst of all.

52. The tendency to let commendation <em>describe</em>. The decadent man says, "It is good." In conversation, the pauses between acts of speech are important. They imply form. Remember: Lexicography is a <em>science. </em>How peculiar to think: Dictionaries are approximations to sense. Well, think: brute fact and institutional fact, brute sense and institutional sense. Now we see the motivation for the logical grammarian. A dictionary is no guarantor of sense.

53. The world: An <em>utterance </em>may realize for its speaker esteem or it may realize gross ridicule. There is something mysterious about contextualist viewpoints, motivations; we distance ourselves wholly from the anthropologist, from the historian, from the physical scientist. What <em>is </em>the "contextualist"? Is she simply that which conjoins us to our "others"? Why did contextualist defusal of radical doubt become a <em>convention </em>(custom)?

54. The <em>motivation </em>behind formality and rigor. There is a binding between it and truth or there is not. Many of us, perhaps those oriented by postmodern condition, deny it to be so. Has professionalism any ontological commitment? But the tick of rigor denies that we can speak clearly while we speak so broadly. Yet the presumption of the former <em>seems </em>so flagrantly pragmatic. The spiral is nevertheless <em>motivated</em>.

55. The animal has nothing more than <em>recognitional capacities. </em>So, we <em>train </em>them. But if you poise a philosophical squint, a harmless "shift," you get a poetry: Perhaps the non-human animal trains the human. He stands and shouts, "Sit!" He raises his arms, and again. He gestures this way and that, and again. Frustration follows. Then he learns; he begins to attenuate his tone but determines his method to a <em>form--</em>"One must command 'Sit' with force but not aggression." The finesse of this contrasted with the precision of a dog's posture.

56. Ontological commitment: <em>every noun names an entity. </em>What counts as "entity"? Does process philosophy get us past our original paradox?

57. Gettier problems are always <em>clever </em>and, perhaps, only superficially dubious in their construction<em>. </em>Our epistemologies must overcome human creativity to invent novel cases. What a standard <em>we </em>set for ourselves! This is the motivation behind the disdain for the Gettier problem, the motivation connected with speaking of now being at a "post-Gettier" phase.

58. Epistemic minimalism: <em>Remember the richness of belief! </em>We must ask: What in fact counts as a belief? We cannot untie ourselves from views of normative belief formation.

59. <span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Even supposing that there are any, and this we certainly <em>must suppose</em>, for it is possible if not likely that they be hidden from us, an objective truth does not entail that one's procedure in obtaining it is objective. Nothing prevents or precludes the possibility that one <em>may stumble </em>into an objective truth, either at the street corner or in the laboratory or during a passionate and sensual experience. A scientist or a lawyer, in the deep and sweat of their messy profession, may happily admit to you that they <em>aim </em>at an ideal procedure -- if they have the <em>time </em>and <em>energy </em>and <em>capacity </em>to speak sincerely yet intelligibly to you about it at all. This embodies the <em>background </em>of discovery -- what makes <em>discovery </em>in science<em> </em>so awesome, "meaningful." (The suggestion that the <em>world as it actually is </em>is more beautiful and inspiring than we can <em>imagine it.</em>) It <em>is </em>a discovery precisely because <em>it took us this long. </em>And this is what philosophy must lack: We mustn't treat the philosopher as if she we a scientist, toiling away for millennia -- just <em>imagine </em>how shocking her discovery will be! (We must put an end to the conflation of science and philosophy; it is an unfortunate and dangerous picture. Notice: The philosopher will <em>happily </em>describe to you her procedure.) And the scientist?: Ever does the feeling loom that this or that article <em>is </em>the mysterious, not the aim of it, its claim, its hypothesis, its evidence, its conclusion. The <em>procedure, </em>the scientific method behind what is expressed, concerns me. How faulty is the presumpion: If you stand where I stand, and nothing more is required, you will reach my conclusion. (The principle of objectivity: What does it mean to "stand in the same place"?) That we should seek objective truths cannot be of itself an objective truth. (Williams)
</span></span>

60. Subjectivism about morality: The anthropologist's heresy or an ignorance as to the nature of moral disagreement.

61. Scientists who lament for having not the capacity to use language to express their ideas are broken bones improperly healed.

62. As if finding a thing implies that one was searching for <em>that </em>thing. The object and method of science, as is presupposed, are never disjoined. A reduction of the meaning in the face of obvious multiplicity.

63. L.W. decries, "...the mistake in the set-theoretical approach consists time and again in treating laws and enumerations (lists) as essentially the same kind of thing" (PG 461) . A list may be a product of a law or not (it is not a list of that particular law). But can it <em>be </em>a list under no law? I write down an ordered-looking arrangement of things. What condition must be met for us to <em>infer </em>a rule? Or <em>do we infer rules at all? </em>Is it the (criterio)logical ground for the rule? Or is it an inductive ground? In any event: A <em>list </em>and a <em>listing. </em>The prescriptivist laments that the ordinary use these interchangeably, or in some cases where the other properly applies. A <em>rule </em>or <em>principle </em>is neither; however, we might say what it yields <em>is a listing. </em>And as a <em>listing </em>we might judge (infer?) that as such it must correspond to a <em>list. </em>Each thing yielded from the rule is a list or a listing. If it is simple, then it is a listing. If it is complex, then it is a list. A law does not <em>end </em>but that which it yields has an ending. Each thing produced by it will be simple or complex, which consists of simples. The irrational number has no <em>end; </em>but that which is written down <em>from the rule </em>is not itself <em>the rule </em>(a totality). Recall: <em>what </em>presents itself is one; what <em>presents </em>itself is multiple. The law is the former clause whereas the expression of the law is the latter.

64. Old thought: the foundation (philosophical roots) of mathematics is the activity of mathematicians.

65. I am in agreement with L.W. that an irrational is a procedure, a technique, a rule. Each yield is an expression its existence, in a way. In the way same, I suppose, that punishment in law, at least, in some cases, is an indication of moral orientation, moral law. Of course, punishment does not <em>explain entirely </em>the basis for moral law. In this same way, no <em>yield </em>of the rule of an irrational <em>properly </em>represents -- they are substantives in different ways. How might I say "my moral code tells me it must be this way" to the skeptic? I might simply say it: And how would the skeptic respond? I see it and hear it everywhere: "Morality tells me to..." "<strong>?</strong> tells me to..." But for morality, do I say "But I cannot?" (( A parallel between "human limitation in mathematics" and the debate between "ought implies can". )) We see that we <em>ought to be able </em>(in principle) to "complete" <strong>? -- </strong>or at least God <em>could. </em>We ought to do such-and-such, or, at least, we can.

66.  A kind of discovery? I have drawn a parallel between "ought implies can" (morality) and "we <em>could </em>[complete] the decimal expansion (in principle; or at least God could". Very frequently do I find morality in mathematics, but I find it difficult to <em>say </em>exactly the commonality.

67. If an irrational is a "rule" or a "procedure", then perhaps shares the logical feature of imperatives. But what is it about imperatives that make them "stick" to the emotion, that make them "relevant", involve human behavior and response. At each finite decimal expansion, the rule states: You ought to continue! I always wish to obey.

68. Those who buy this hierarchy of infinities business seem religious, or at least they ought to be treated as if they were. And this means we either must be condescending to mathematicians or philosophically patient with the religious!

69. Can a computer <em>not </em>think but nevertheless act? On what grounds would we say that an artificially intelligent system acted <em>thoughtlessly? </em>I imagine our response would be: "That machine needs an update!" "Thoughtlessly" for a machine means "of an inadequate <em>model </em>or <em>make --</em> something lacking <em>internally</em>." But for human organisms? Do we say "Bob thoughtlessly did such-and-such" and mean that Bob <em>internally </em>lacked a property? (( Context versus the internal. ))

70. "The condition for a human organism's being this or that way is different from the condition (or criteria) for an artificially intelligence system." But is this entirely so? I once held to the idea: A machine <em>makes a mistake. </em>But what does it mean to "make a mistake" generally? And now under the <em>known premise </em>(evidence) that it is a machine. Suppose this occurs 300 years from now, when machines will be further integrated and enmeshed in our ordinary living. Or perhaps 400 years, 500, and so on. This resembles Sorite's paradox reasoning for the meaning of the term "consciousness." But have I shown it to be an empty concept? Or have I suggested that it flows with the times -- the here and the now? A definition relative to its context; <em>but should we call it a definition? </em>A definition sounds, often, final; to call a thing a "tentative and putative definition" <em>consciously so </em>seems counterintuitive. We get no legwork out of such talk! But back to my point: A machine <em>makes a mistake. </em>I asserted: The condition or circumstance under which we ascribe error <em>to the machine </em>(and not its author) is the condition for <em>similarity in consciousness. </em>Indeed, this assertion depends on the acceptance of "consciousness as a family resemblance concept." How circular is it for a <em>conscious being </em>to pause and <em>define </em>consciousness? Is this a case of language going on holidy? A case where a word is not doing its proper work under <em>an </em>intended context. The speaker mentions it, but does not use it. Imagine the philosopher as standing between quotation marks through her entire lecture. Imagine a universe between quotation marks. Now reflect on how, or the conditions under which you might <em>connect </em>that which betwene the marks and its <em>context. </em>We have scare quotes, styles of Houses, of consortiums, the use-mention distinction, irony, titles, emphasis, etc. Though incorrect, <em>why </em>is the quotation mark used as such <em>incorrect? </em>And does your answer have any bearing on what I have outlined? Might it nevertheless be used in such a way, to convey the meaning of that which <em>should </em>be used (in some contexts)? Of course, now the question becomes: "I cannot see a paradigm case! So your argument falls flat!"

71. Transcendentalist metaphysics as a <em>misconception </em>of ontological commitment. This seems similar to the "mistake" of treating an irrational number (though <em>properly </em>a rule) as a substantive under the same conception as blocks, cars and houses. The skeptic asks: "But is obeying a rule after one initially resisted <em>really </em>a case of the rule being obeyed?" And then we acknowledge the commitment to objectivity: "Yes, but we must <em>agree </em>on what it means to "resist" and <em>that this is a case of obeying a rule at all </em>(for you to be skeptical about)." The skeptic becomes anxious, of course, and attempts to play our game, if she is bold enough. "But does agreement consist in our entertaining the same <em>words</em>? What <em>confirms </em>that we are even speaking with the same meanings? Is <em>intending </em>with the opposed or conflicting <em>facial expression </em>really a case of intending?" -- And thus we notice the limit of the skeptical: it is the limit of my ability, anyone's ability, to construct him. (( The limit of the skeptic is the limit of our imagination. ))

72. There is no reason to assume the "transcendental" on ground of our inability to continue the skeptical trick. Moreover, although, we should not be fooled that, instead, the "transcendental" is the "principle of skepticism." We should not be fooled by the conviction the "skeptic" exists in our hearts. As if God planted a "philosopher" in each of us. We must deny that Socrates indeed <em>discovered </em>knowledge in the boy in the <em>Meno</em>. The discovery is properly his method. His <em>method </em>discovered what it presupposed; I draw from this that not even Socrates existed. For to say that he <em>did exist</em>, in exactly the heartfelt and <em>religious </em>way a "philosopher" wishes to, is to claim that he <em>does exist </em>(as a principle). We do call it the Socratic <em>Method.</em> (( A confusion of <em>kinds </em>of substantives. ))

73. Historico-anthropological claim: "I cannot go on!" becomes the ground for our common vocabulary of substantives under a particular kind (the irrationals, "father" of the divine chain, etc).

74. A holism all the way through. God cannot exist outside of a linguistic practice. Is God's existence "true but not provable" or "true but not proved"? But this is a mistake: "We are concerned with consistency and decidability. If consistent, then undecidability will occur. If decidable, we will mar our consistency. And we might not <em>realize </em>it! <em>This </em>is the problem! We might find ourselves "deciding" on those mysterious propositions that cropped up in our system! Why? Well, we <em>assumed </em>our consistent: We had no reason to go back and check!" Thus, we need a <em>constraint </em>on what it means to <em>realize </em>a thing, <em>realization </em>within a system. We see a connection between: truth, proof, consistency and decidability.

Soundness is a property of logical inference <em>and </em>logical systems wherein inference takes place. If P ? A is provable (or derivable), then P ? A. "P ? A" is an exemplification of a semantic entailment. From truth <em>must </em>come another truth. "P ? A" a syntactic entailment; this form is concerned with <em>preserving </em>truth (of semantic entailment).

75. <em>Russell's paradox. </em>Sets consist of members. A set can be a member of another set; and sets can fail to be a member of another set. A set can be described numerically, or demonstratively (simply point to all the members). We say, O={1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Conversely, we say "the odd numbers between 0 and 10." This is an intensional method. We specify a property and check from that property every member in the domain who could or does have that property. The former is explicit, discrete, clear. The latter is subject to <em>meaning. </em>If I demonstrate to you <em>this, that, </em>and <em>the other, </em>nothing is amiss or lost. However, nothing is really conveyed other than that which is pointed to. The extensional method is a demonstration by list. The latter is a description which yields a list.

We say: A cat is a member, or could be a member, of a set. A cat, however, is not a set. A cat is a mammal; but it could be seen as a set. We could sat, idiomatically: look at that <em>set of fur</em>. But we would <em>mean </em>the cat. The set of the first 10 integers <em>means </em>a thing which consists of some members (that thing is a set). A set of 10 pies is not itself a pie; it is a set. We can point out 10 pies or we can say "the pies on the table." We observe the properties of <em>being on the table</em> and <em>being a pie. </em>We can say <em>the months in a year </em>or <em>list every month. </em>The set of the months is not itself a month. A list which contains one listing per month is not itself one of the listings on its own list.

RP claims: there exists a set which contains all sets who are not members of themselves. So, we have our set of pies, cats and months, none of which is a member of itself. RP claims, minimally, there is a set which consists of sets. What does it mean to be a set? Is a set a construct of a theory? A posit? In what way does it exist? Do sets exist objectively or subjectively? Are we <em>committed </em>to sets when we speak in ordinary language? Is a set a bias of the analytical mode? Do we <em>fail </em>to achieve analysis if we presuppose that a set is not intelligible or real or extant? Does a set <em>ground </em>our analytical procedure or do we <em>suppose </em>it as ground? Is it impossible to <em>analyze </em>linguistic phenomena without this theory? What, moreover, does it <em>mean </em>to analyze a thing?

RP supposes this set to exist (in some way or other). Is it a member of itself? By its own (intensional) description, it might. It <em>is </em>a set at least, but is it a member in the set of all sets who are not members of themselves? We might <em>look </em>to see or we can suppose (a theoretical or intellectual effort). What would <em>looking </em>afford us? Well, would we be <em>looking </em>with our "mind's eye"? So we suppose that it is a member of itself. If it is a member of itself, then the set of all sets who are not members of themselves (a) contains a set which is a member of itself and (b) who is itself. If it is not a member of itself, then the set of all sets who are not members of themselves does not contain itself; that is, is not a member of itself. But by its own description (our supposition of its existence), it is <em>supposed </em>to be a member of itself.

I intimated this earlier: A <em>backdrop </em>from which you <em>judge </em>the correspondance between the intensional definition and the possibility of correspondance. <em>To be a possibility </em>requires a broad enough background. If I say: <em>The pies on the table. </em>Well, I must <em>look </em>at the entire table (the bare multiplicity w/r/t by description); <em>then </em>I am able to compare my (intensional) description with the <em>possibility set. </em>Then I <em>pick out </em>from my description. But what <em>grounds </em>the possibility set? That is, what shapes <em>its </em>contours? A possibility set comes about from an application. The table becomes my possibility set by presupposition of my intensional description. It was simply a table <em>before </em>my speech act? But do speech acts invoke possibility sets? Well, I could write it down on a paper. But what of the demonstrative method? "But I must know <em>what </em>to demonstrate!"All this is to say: members cannot merely be checked for properties. Members are ultimately members of some set or other. <em>The cats in the tree </em>is one set, some <em>other </em>set is the one behind our explicit one. The possibility set is tacit, discernibly undisclosed. But are we <em>committed </em>to it on pain of ...? But do not think: "possibility set" is a contradiction in terms. Clearly we <em>invoke </em>some contours by our intellectualizing. But how is <em>this </em>shaping and grounding possible?

76. The TM, Gödel's proof, arithmetic (number theory), and the predicate calculus: related by <em>conduit metaphor</em>. Each is a vessel for a conceptual metaphor. The "problems" are contained commonly in each (Cantor's trick by interpretation). There is the syntactical maneuver (the diagonal) and the semantic sleight of hand (the "consequences" which <em>must </em>be drawn; we <em>must </em>see things <em>this </em>way). (Normativity in mathematics means: "Reduce the impact of intra-metaphorical language within our system and inter-metaphorical transport or reduction between near-formal systems."; All "near-formal system" means is "idealized language game." -- Arithmetic, TMs, etc, as the old hat says, are idealized language games.)

77. Lakoff &amp; Johnsen: Metaphors (and metonymies) indicate the the kind of (or cultural) spectacles by which we perceive, apprehend, and conceive the world. The metaphor is the dressing cast 'round our brand of thought and experience. Every metaphor is a shibboleth. (Do we choose the metaphor we employ? And what if we show the whole region of language to be metaphorical in grounding? What sense does it make to speak of choosing a metaphor? -- for a poet? for a philosopher? for a scientist? for the ordinary many?)

78. Is it a moral (or religious) requirement (duty) to accept a metonymic or metaphoric use of language? If we are resistant to it, in recognizing what it is, are we tacitly expected or bound (in some specific <em>and</em> abstract sense) to approbate it as our own? (Socially speaking? Is it a social constraint?) What pains do we incur in rejecting a language game implicitly or explicitly?

79. Suppose we inductively form a binary correspondence between thought and expression of thought. In us is produced the intuition that they <em>become</em> identical. "Functionally" it is tenable. The <em>results</em> determine the meaning of what it is to <em>function</em>. It is an article of faith that only little detachment, noise and interference arises between result and function. Of course, we say "Yes, indeed, they are <em>not</em> identical, but we are <em>warranted</em> in treating them <em>as such</em>" (where "as such" and "as if" collapse into one another as locutions -- perhaps an analogue: suppose the "is" of attribution and the "is" of identity were conflated to the point of being indistinguishable; "And you mean what by 'is' here?" -- "Well, I'm not quite sure.").

80. Is a knot a physical or logical impossibility to untangle? Less hyperbolically: Is a knot a physical or a logical <em>problem</em>? Suppose that a knot were undecidable? What would this mean? How could we fail to establish a rule by which we conclude that<em> it is no longer</em> a knot? What will we <em>say</em> is a knot and what is not? The "knot" that resembles the infinity symbol <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/2/4/d245777abca64ece2d5d7ca0d19fddb6.png" alt="" /> (or two-thirds of a Gordian Knot), the ones that occur in entangled Christmas lights and chords (for no apparent reason). But is it really a knot? No technique or skill is required to untangle it, you simply expand it and pull one end through, supposing it to have a point of termination. (Naturally, the realist in us asks: suppose it to have no points of termination? How did it come to exist? Could it exist? Is it a chimera that you speak of?) But first: do we call <em>this</em> a knot in the first place? (Our answer: What we <em>call</em> it determines the method by which it is untangled.) The point of contention: Can a knot be unwound a priori? -- "Well, of course, it is possible!" And we mean what by "possibility" here? That human nature can overcome any problematic? Your basis for this is: Your intuition? Your humanity? Do you make a statement of fact or an imperative: How I ought to view human nature.

81. The <em>position</em> (or circumstance) in which you ask a question will determine the meaning of that question. (How could an objective meaning even <em>get in</em>? Infiltrate? Gain entrance? -- these metaphors presuppose the same logical space; but if I said "permeate" (a virus never infects the whole organism, a spy never, literally, the entirety of the government; but the <em>physical body</em> and the <em>physical buildings</em>, perhaps)? or "orient"? These are descriptions which presuppose as basis the objective meaning: We do <em>not</em> apprehend or fumble within our foundations (for we fumble as we speak sometimes); we step into (sense) or out of (nonsense) them; and this is my old hat: the foundation is language). The meanings themselves are shifting fields on which the firing occurs at the time of the utterance. A firing <em>is</em> a meaning.

82. We see the "world picture" and the picture before us at odds when we think of imperatives. We employ the locutions "the kind of world I would like to live in..." and "I imagine a world wherein everyone..." (ethical possible world semantics for the ordinary) in our moral reasoning. Implicit is the imperative of universalizability, but we speak descriptively insofar as we give a picture of the world we desire. This is where emotivism holds: A possible world is nothing more than a reflection (or expression) of one's desire. Why? Well, this speech act could do nothing more than this: I have no access to some world as you imagine it. No verbal agreement will establish that I could, for I must agree with you on what "world" means, and this points us back at the beginning of our question.

Suppose I tell you, implicitly or explicitly: You simply must find good some painting present before us. To do this explicitly seems odd: A taboo, opposed to standing social conventions. So odd is it that it may seem unimaginable that it actually occurs. But what of situations of authority, where relata are teacher and child, mentor and apprentice, professor and student, etc. Well, the professor-student relationship is explicit, I say, or at least not obviously implicit. The professor of art history stands before hundreds of students and presumes the import and significance of <em>this</em> or <em>that</em> work. (Some of you will have the urge to ask: "Okay, <em>which</em> works? Give me examples" -- And this only proves my point; and if you are "a mathematician" or "a computer scientist" or "an engineer"...?) And the point is this question: <em>Is a </em><em>presumption</em> an explicit gesture maneuver?

When one tells me of the world she would like to live in, where every individual is like-minded, am I being coerced? What if I do not emphatically and passionately reject this world? Why might I not? The presumption becomes explicit to whom? The philosopher? The moral critic? The anarchist or "postmodern" toward pictures? The vulgar anti-foundationalist? The "constructivist"? Does the concept of <em>this</em> presumption involve, or perhaps require, an imperative?

What good is an imagined counterfactual situation if it is not to be advanced to some other? So we constrain our "possible world semantics" to "local possible worlds." And by "world" we mean some arbitrary delineation of our culture (Lakoff &amp; Johnson). (Possible worlds as containers of events and situations / the visual field as literal container of what is viewed; it is metaphorical because it is literal (the letters do not actually contain what is perceived. But the possible world is a metaphor. What is before me has trees, verdant green, blazing sun and clear sky; the visual field does not contain it. These things, features before us, are not contained by anything. But the metaphor makes possible the containment. Similarly, events and situations are not contained by anything. Possible worlds make possible the containment. If I tell you that I do not see the deer behind the patch of forest before us, a click beyond the nearest rock; and what if I tell you: "I cannot see that consequence from the 'might have been otherwise' you suppose"? Well, I have not misunderstood the make-up of possible world semantics; I have seen aright: We perceive rocks, perceive events all the same. But I do not perceive your perceptions or my own. But what is a possible world? How might I perceive it? Is it a thing before us? (The objectivity required for the possibility of metaphor.)

83. If you want a definitive answer to a moral judgment, that's a different affair than as to all what your judgment is <em>doing</em>, or what you are doing in virtue of <em>making</em> such a judgment, when you employ it. The latter is much more puzzling and important to the study of ethics.

84. A society, its morality, and its law are each structured wholes. Each must be one way or the other. The limit of law is expressed in that morality would not give it recourse under certain circumstances or conditions. Where morality does not tread, law certainly must remain at bay. But the question becomes: Is morality always the first to take the questionable step? The naturalist answers affirmatively; the positivist answers that law should open the boundaries of moral permissibility. The positivist thinker, moreover, believes that morality is the watched, law the watcher. Morality, that is, cannot be arbiter to itself; it can only feebly go, whereas law goes by order, rationality, and careful scrutiny.

Is morality a feeling? What could we mean by "social feeling"? Well, by social we mean something more general; indeed, morality and law are merely aspects, derivatives, of the social. We were certainly social before lawful, before moral. But do social conventions dictate the direction of our morality? Of our law? Here the social is more primal (primitive) and raw, untamed. The logic that grounds morality is often overlooked: but of the social? Is decorum, etiquette, the platitude logically prior to common morality? You cannot demand that someone be polite from a moral point of view. Social norm by morality is everywhere "permissible"; legal norms (questions, propositions): impermissible or obligatory. Think of a legal question that is deemed unexceptional by morality.

85. The distinction between linear (historical) and logical cause. Modus Ponens is not a spatial principle. Validity by it does not rest on the place of those symbols who represent. Validity hinges upon the logical space (logical cause) and the reasoning in that space as the ground. We deal with a different picture when we deal with logical space. But is this picture connected with the world of sensibility? This question orients the departure of correspondence-truth and realism. But as we have taken for granted: "logical space" is a picture-building term. Moreover, a metaphor. No one need belabor the point: "space" isn't the absence of all things, unoccupied locality in this context. What does it mean to say "the logical constructions occupy (or do not occupy) this region in logical space"? Obviously we've taken the metaphor too far here. But why do people fumble when learning Modus Ponens because certain linguistic representations ("If cats..."; "cats..."; etc) of it fail to be "intuitive"? Or fail to "make sense" to our cultural intuitions? (We confuse the historical problem with the logical; that is, we miss what is being said about logical space, and we become concerned with uninteresting "historical," fact-finding questions.)

86. The "Buffalo"-sentence: Buffalo<sup>adj</sup> buffalo<sup>n</sup> Buffalo<sup>adj</sup> buffalo<sup>n</sup> buffalo<sup>v</sup>, buffalo<sup>v</sup> Buffalo<sup>adj</sup> buffalo<sup>n</sup>.
The Chomsky-sentence: Colorless<sup>adj</sup> green<sup>adj</sup> ideas<sup>n</sup> sleep<sup>v</sup> furiously<sup>adv</sup>

The former has sense, or it can record a fact. The latter cannot. Both are grammatical. But the popular suspicious turns on whether the former is "meaningful" outside of discourse in linguistic study. The suggestion is that the sentence, if spoken in casual conversation, would be so idiosyncratic that it must either be taken as an invitation to a study of language or simply a jest. Chomsky, moreover, admits the latter to having never been uttered until the time of his writing SS. The same may be said of the former. But what is this divergence of "meaning"? Well, we philosophers are talking about propositional meaning, sense at all or senselessness. Surely "conversational meaning" is broader, and is not reducible to, "sense" in our cumbersome idiom. "conversational meaning" captures culture, familiarity with terms, presence with terms, history with language, wherein "making sense" becomes a culturally constrained activity.

In religious discourse of the everyday, what "makes sense" is likely what is not atheistic w/r/t some doctrine. But it is strange that the actual intelligibility of expression and the competence of the speaker in his linguistic practice is brought into question. But now we have a logical question, not a question on linear cause. The departure turns on the possibility of grammar outside of a cultural practice -- "making sense" outside of a language game.

87. Philosophy is the capacity to misspell words.

88. "A society, in part, is defined by those questions of which it refuses to take a position" (Gaita). We may observe a society from two stations: the Anthropological (external) and the Political (internal). These perspectives are such that  we orient ourselves and our investigation of <em>cultural concepts.</em> At bottom we are concerned with the thriving and existence of certain concepts within a culture, whether a concept can be said to be active or passive, explicit or tacit, normative or ignored, etc. (whether a concept can be said to exist within a culture and what exactly this amounts to).

The Anthropologist, or the external view, is concerned with the measure and concrete limits of a concept, the grounds for its application by those to whom the concept is vibrant, active, employed, cognizant, etc. The external view is concerned with the pattern and strict behavior of a concept or set of. Certain conditions are met which ground the successful or unsuccessful application of a concept. Conditions may either be necessary or sufficient, or both. One has successfully applied or used a concept when the sufficient conditions for its application are met. Without question it is unclear that a concept ever is employed <em>sufficiently, </em>or with maximal success. For the most part, pragmatic constraints on conversation <em>determine </em>the meaning of "successful application of a concept." However, at minimum, it seems to me, the lack of any necessary condition whatever, as explicit or implicit, determines the failure of application. (That is, one is not speaking within the language game of that culture. One may, we might say, be introducing a novel necessary condition or at least proposition a new condition as a candidate to complete or partial sufficiency.) If I say of a cat that <em>it is on a unicorn, </em>it is required of me to be speaking of a thing which meets the condition or set of conditions of cat-hood. At the same time, the preposition's grounding, the article's, etc must each lend to the (complete) sufficient condition of the proposition "The cat is on a unicorn." This proposition has a sense which is grounded by the necessary conditions of its constituents which themselves lend to the first-order necessary conditions of the proposition itself. The constituents' condition sit at the second-order, or of a lower order generally. We may say that a statement does not record if one of its lower order necessary conditions is not met. So, if "on" does not accord with the actual state of affairs, we may say that the speaker has failed to properly apply the concept "on" and has at the same time failed to acknowledge the <em>actual ground </em>of the appropriate preposition, say "under."

Questions of this sort may be entertained from the external view. The Anthropologist is concerned with whether speakers successfully or unsuccessfully apply concepts at local contexts, intervals, where, when, why (descriptively).

From the internal perspective or viewpoint, we will be concerned with the correct or incorrect application of  a concept. "Beauty," by Kant's standard, was seen as Political in the way I shall describe. The concept of beauty, under Kantian presentation, was seen as, when invoked by a speaker, a candidate of some form. The speaker intends for hearers to agree or to at least consider whether the item, object or artifact in question is <em>by agreement </em>beautiful. We should not say "objectively beautiful." The speaker is raising the object in question as a candidate for a <em>policy. </em>If two persons consider a thing beautiful, then this bolsters <em>their </em>political weight (as I see it), <em>not </em>the ontological status of the object itself. The objective or subjective nature of the item, this status, is a question of another order. I cannot immediately see what the metaphysical pedigree of an item has to do with two persons in discussion and whether or not they agree on explicit or potentially explicit properties. This is one feature of the internal view with which I am interested: candidacy of an object wherein it might receive a new property. Does "beauty" emerge from an object? Is "beauty" a relation between <em>agreement </em>and the <em>object? </em>That is: Let's disregard the question of "beauty as related to a subjective state." Let us regard beauty as a concept which bears a relation to <em>agreements </em>or <em>events of agreement.</em>

More generally, what is the ontological status of <em>agreement? </em>(Ignore questions as to the ontological status of "beautiful objects.")

89. "We can obey the laws together." What would make this a true statement? Is there empirical evidence which might lend support to the proposition represented by the statement? All statements which can be questioned as to having any possible physical evidence are automatically <em>insens. </em>And this presupposes that such a question could even be asked.

90. A new beginning -- we revisit old thoughts, establish conceptual connections wherebefore obscurity ran deep on account of the practicality of things.

91. Stories exist, and by degrees of imperative. Certain tales, as it were, I find either must be accepted or rejected, where the grounds for one's status as accepting or reject simply do not enter the situation. Isolated situations, talk exchanges, interpersonal activity, etc would be the foreground whereof such <em>grounds </em>would count as relevant, given the right circumstances. Naturally, some may say "This is not a topic which is open for discussion," as the context or the site of the talk exchange is viewed as inappropriate from a kind of discussion essential to understanding. Now the fact that this occurs is manifestly true, plain to any observer, but the question, indeed, is why such grounds <em>tend </em>to, under a general observation, fail to count as appropriate more so than they would be viewed as appropriate within a culture. An example may be the discussability of torture. Wherebefore a tragic attack on a culture's people and esteemed artifacts, the topic's discussability remain implicit, after the fact, the topic's discussability may take on an "open" status. The important question, plainly, is: <em>What occurred? </em>What happened to adjust the moral categories to the given culture so as to permit the topic's discussability? "Moral outrage" would be an answer that presupposes a notion such as: "Certain crimes must be met with certain punishments. And in order to apply those punishments, we must address which kinds of punishment count as <em>retribution.</em>" Conceptually, torture may be viewed as a kind of retributive punishment. Of course, the assumption here is that <em>in applying torture one is punishing the Other. </em>Well, this is a contentious assumption, perhaps: Surely when one requires information to prevent a devastating future attack, torture is viewed on practical grounds. However, merely because one internalizes torture in this way, such an opinion does not necessarily block the perceived view of the act which follows from the maxim: punishment, in a large sense, is <em>perceived, </em>and defined in terms of <em>public criteria </em>which is embodied by the culture's conceptual scheme.

92. Again, stories exist. At the abstract anthropological level of theorizing, we view cultures in terms of their metanarratives. A metanarrative, then, would be a story, a story which functions, so to speak, as a unifying point for a particular culture from which beliefs and imperatives emerge. Certain artifacts and archetypes compose the structure of any metanarrative, where the particular agents who instantiate those archetypes or the particular corporeal constructs which embody those artifacts. These entities make up the tangible, ontological basis of the metanarrative. Moreover, events, and not time, define the temporal progression of a metanarrative; scientific precision aims at observation under the aspect of no event as such. A trivial claim, to be sure, but in this way we force a demarcation between a subsidiary tale to a metanarrative (a child conceptual scheme) and the metanarrative under which it falls: the extreme scientific worldview (scientism) and Western thought.

"Scientific heroes" and Science have an influence on the general idiom of the Western metanarrative. By influence we mean that the local, or minor tale, engenders ways of speaking deviant and alien to the broader idiom (jargon, etc). Again, this is a trivial claim, but it exposes a conceptual relationship, I believe, between archetypes under cultural localities and denizens of its broader cultural context. We point to hustle and tussle between cultural locations: music subculture and scientific subculture, say. Persistent in these cultures, it is assumed, is a collection of principles, rules or imperatives that fundamentally distinguish them from one another. Denizens of the greater cultural structure, it is my assumption, internalize archetypes and express their features <em>as prototypical persona</em>. I describe their behavior in this way to identify a feature of talk exchanges, wherein ideas are expressed and digested. This idea is connected with Putnam's claim about appeal to scientific authority in Reference, and I hope my thoughts expose its conceptual structure. Participants, in most cases unknowingly, employ idiomatic ways of talking which presuppose the veracity of scientific findings. Conceptual connections in the wider culture may ride on the production and existence of scientific theories. The point here depends on the description of the Scientific as a subsidiary tale to the metanarrative. Participants in wider culture do not necessarily consider themselves as <em>part </em>of the tale, but yet they are an expression of its influence and they sing its song. ...

93. An infant under the sun, mandarin oranges glistening under the humbling rays; the hermit speaks of a day when shadows held their way. The corners furnished pathways into the depths behind the innocuous darkness we grew so comfortably ubiquitous, and yet we penetrated into the many layered horrors of our everyday banality. The shadow held within the total withdrawal of presence, named those absent possibilities which circumscribe actuality. Though impossible, in virtue of a name, principally constructible, the actual derives no meaning from itself, and thus from such as they are, must be constituted by their constructibility, their capacity for being named, structured.

94. Of all the things to have stuck on one's mind: &lt;table&gt;s. I find it odd, just as an anthropological note, that the &lt;table&gt; got abused before the concept of the table in Web development. Why do I say this is odd? Is it so clear that the &lt;table&gt; had specification before the concept of the table? One would think, as a designer, "Tables are quite bland. Why would we ever employ them to represent us?" The table appears Platonic to the designer, one who is ruggedly disinterested in the academic limitations of her craft. So one must wonder -- maybe not.

95. Meta-commercials: writers author/represent their "giving up" creatively through the strictures of the television program format. The unabashed underscore of failure is in itself entertaining, building on the viewer's inherent capacity to relate himself to the humanity in the letter. Again: why do conservationist foundations invest in commercials which blithely ignore the sympathetic trend Westerners have toward "eco-rescue"? A better approach would be to specify in woeful detail, perhaps with a scientific or matter of fact tone, the consequence of a certain extinction of certain species. Moreover, this is a prompt to imagine the mechanisms of evolution, or at least build metaphor into them -- for the greater public to internalize. In truth, it seems to me, by observing, highlighting, socializing and commercializing the more excitable, flamboyant and yet nevertheless ultimately contingent and arbitrary features of certain specifies one misses the opportunity to introduce a more estimable reason for that species existence; think: <em>This </em>species<em> sustains our ecosystem. </em>By relating the species to us, we help actualize the humanity in it. If we are doom'd to metaphor, as the neurophilosophers would have it, then why not acknowledge our taxonomy of values and exploit them for the matured protection of our neighboring species: no one cares on the matter of a certain species speed, dexterity, capacity to mimic human forms of communication. It is all ultimately pragmatic; acknowledge, so too, then, the human weakness: pragmatic egotism.

96. In one's duties, one may be task'd with operating under roles typically held by one person. Odd is it where this is fail'd to be sustain in one's conscious awareness, given that a role is satisfied within the complex interactions of a social system. The role exists primitively in expression yet manifests through human activity and error. The identification of a role is in itself problematic, seeing as that roles must first be stipulated. Failing to observe and respect the shape of one's participation within a social ecosystem must itself be constitutive of the role through which one contributes.

97. At one moment an artifact of language may sway those about us, at another -- that same artifact -- may turn them inert and lame. This is a feature of language, a feature not explicable in terms of truth. Such a concept provides no wedge or tool to distinguish the meaningful from the gaseous. What says that truth resonates save for the vehicle which drives it, sometimes precisely, others feebly? What links those honorific propositions so disconcerting to human concerns and the intelligentsia save for the gardens of linguistic activity?

98. As Plato should, would and actually did have it the psychologist today is an allowance of society to its poets; we should say these trainers preserve the hygiene of the populous. And there are poets, jesters and so forth of many stripes. Why <em>must</em> I accept that I not only may be mistaken inwardly, but also that each gem, reflection, interaction, encounter, and so forth, so too may be the only interest, for it, of me, of an auto-cannabalistic orientation to rebuild into artifice only these destitute and unpalatable remains of mistaken forms?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Poems I've enjoyed (incomplete). My poems are <a title="Poems by Aaron Alexander" href="/topics/poetry/">elsewhere</a>.
<h2>Borges and I</h2>
The other one, the one called Borges, is the one things happen to. I walk through the streets of Buenos Aires and stop for a moment, perhaps mechanically now, to look at the arch of an entrance hall and the grillwork on the gate; I know of Borges from the mail and see his name on a list of professors or in a biographical dictionary. I like hourglasses, maps, eighteenth-century typography, the taste of coffee and the prose of Stevenson; he shares these preferences, but in a vain way that turns them into the attributes of an actor. It would be an exaggeration to say that ours is a hostile relationship; I live, let myself go on living, so that Borges may contrive his literature, and this literature justifies me. It is no effort for me to confess that he has achieved some valid pages, but those pages cannot save me, perhaps because what is good belongs to no one, not even to him, but rather to the language and to tradition. Besides, I am destined to perish, definitively, and only some instant of myself can survive in him. Little by little, I am giving over everything to him, though I am quite aware of his perverse custom of falsifying and magnifying things.

Spinoza knew that all things long to persist in their being; the stone eternally wants to be a stone and the tiger a tiger. I shall remain in Borges, not in myself (if it is true that I am someone), but I recognize myself less in his books than in many others or in the laborious strumming of a guitar. Years ago I tried to free myself from him and went from the mythologies of the suburbs to the games with time and infinity, but those games belong to Borges now and I shall have to imagine other things. Thus my life is a flight and I lose everything and everything belongs to oblivion, or to him.

I do not know which of us has written this page.

<div class="poem">
<pre>Elle est retrouvée.
Quoi ? - L’Eternité.
C’est la mer allée
Avec le soleil.

Ame sentinelle,
Murmurons l’aveu
De la nuit si nulle
Et du jour en feu.

Des humains suffrages,
Des communs élans
Là tu te dégages
Et voles selon.

Puisque de vous seules,
Braises de satin,
Le Devoir s’exhale
Sans qu’on dise : enfin.

Là pas d’espérance,
Nul orietur.
Science avec patience,
Le supplice est sûr.

Elle est retrouvée.
Quoi ? - L’Eternité.
C’est la mer allée
Avec le soleil.</pre>

<h2>Twistable Turnable Man</h2>
<pre>He's the Twistable Turnable Squeezable Pullable
Stretchable Foldable Man.
He can crawl in your pocket or fit your locket
Or screw himself into a twenty-volt socket,
Or stretch himself up to the steeple or taller,
Or squeeze himself into a thimble or smaller,
Yes he can, course he can,
He's the Twistable Turnable Squeezable Pullable
Stretchable Shrinkable Man.
And he lives a passable life
With his Squeezable Lovable Kissable Hugable
Pullable Tugable Wife.
And they have two twistable kids
Who bend up the way that they did.
And they turn and they stretch
Just as much as they can
For this Bendable Foldable
Do-what-you're-toldable
Easily moldable
Buy-what you're-soldable
Washable Mendable
Highly Dependable
Buyable Saleable
Always available
Bounceable Shakeable
Almost unbreakable
Twistable Turnable Man.</pre>
<cite>— Shel Silverstein </cite>

<div class="poem">
<pre>Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.</pre>

<div class="poem">
<h2>The Pope's Penis</h2>
<pre>It hangs deep in his robes, a delicate
clapper at the center of a bell.
It moves when he moves, a ghostly fish in a
halo of silver sweaweed, the hair
swaying in the dark and the heat — and at night
while his eyes sleep, it stands up
in praise of God.</pre>

<div class="poem">
<h2>Metonymy as an Approach to a Real World</h2>
<pre>Whether what we sense of this world
is the what of this world only, or the what
of which of several possible worlds
— which what? — something of what we sense
may be true, may be the world, what it is, what we sense.
For the rest, a truce is possible, the tolerance
of travelers, eating foreign foods, trying words
that twist the tongue, to feel that time and place,
not thinking that this is the real world.

Conceded, that all the clocks tell local time;
conceded, that "here" is anywhere we bound
and fill a space; conceded, we make a world:
is something caught there, contained there,
something real, something which we can sense?
Once in a city blocked and filled, I saw
the light lie in the deep chasm of a street,
palpable and blue, as though it had drifted in
from say, the sea, a purity of space.</pre>

<div class="poem">
<h2>To his Coy Mistress</h2>
<pre>Had we but world enough, and time,
This coyness, lady, were no crime.
We would sit down and think which way
To walk, and pass our long love's day;
Thou by the Indian Ganges' side
Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide
Of Humber would complain. I would
Love you ten years before the Flood;
And you should, if you please, refuse
Till the conversion of the Jews.
My vegetable love should grow
Vaster than empires, and more slow.
An hundred years should go to praise
Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;
Two hundred to adore each breast,
But thirty thousand to the rest;
An age at least to every part,
And the last age should show your heart.
For, lady, you deserve this state,
Nor would I love at lower rate.

        But at my back I always hear
Time's winged chariot hurrying near;
And yonder all before us lie
Deserts of vast eternity.
Thy beauty shall no more be found,
Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound
My echoing song; then worms shall try
That long preserv'd virginity,
And your quaint honour turn to dust,
And into ashes all my lust.
The grave's a fine and private place,
But none I think do there embrace.

        Now therefore, while the youthful hue
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,
And while thy willing soul transpires
At every pore with instant fires,
Now let us sport us while we may;
And now, like am'rous birds of prey,
Rather at once our time devour,
Than languish in his slow-chapp'd power.
Let us roll all our strength, and all
Our sweetness, up into one ball;
And tear our pleasures with rough strife
Thorough the iron gates of life.
Thus, though we cannot make our sun
Stand still, yet we will make him run.</pre>

<h2>The Server</h2>
<pre>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I websurfed, weak and weary,
Over many a strange and curious site of “chicks galore”,

While I clicked my fav'rite bookmark, suddenly there came a warning,
And my heart was filled with mourning, mourning for my dear amour.
"Noooo...," I cried, "give me back my cheap hardcore!" -
Quote the server, “404”.

And the cursor, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
'neath the address bar that begot the 404.
And it's presence screams the meaning that I badly needed weaning
From my favorite porn star, Lenore
My lovely mysterious chick who shall be listed
Nevermore</pre>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="byline"><em>JANUARY 1996</em>
<em>BY <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/">Bill Gates</a></em></div>

Content is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting.

The television revolution that began half a century ago spawned a number of industries, including the manufacturing of TV sets, but the long-term winners were those who used the medium to deliver information and entertainment.

When it comes to an interactive network such as the Internet, the definition of "content" becomes very wide. For example, computer software is a form of content-an extremely important one, and the one that for Microsoft will remain by far the most important.

But the broad opportunities for most companies involve supplying information or entertainment. No company is too small to participate.

One of the exciting things about the Internet is that anyone with a PC and a modem can publish whatever content they can create. In a sense, the Internet is the multimedia equivalent of the photocopier. It allows material to be duplicated at low cost, no matter the size of the audience.

The Internet also allows information to be distributed worldwide at basically zero marginal cost to the publisher. Opportunities are remarkable, and many companies are laying plans to create content for the Internet.

For example, the television network NBC and Microsoft recently agreed to enter the interactive news business together. Our companies will jointly own a cable news network, MSNBC, and an interactive news service on the Internet. NBC will maintain editorial control over the joint venture.

I expect societies will see intense competition-and ample failure as well as success-in all categories of popular content-not just software and news, but also games, entertainment, sports programming, directories, classified advertising, and on-line communities devoted to major interests.

Printed magazines have readerships that share common interests. It’s easy to imagine these communities being served by electronic online editions.

But to be successful online, a magazine can’t just take what it has in print and move it to the electronic realm. There isn’t enough depth or interactivity in print content to overcome the drawbacks of the online medium.

If people are to be expected to put up with turning on a computer to read a screen, they must be rewarded with deep and extremely up-to-date information that they can explore at will. They need to have audio, and possibly video. They need an opportunity for personal involvement that goes far beyond that offered through the letters-to-the-editor pages of print magazines.

A question on many minds is how often the same company that serves an interest group in print will succeed in serving it online. Even the very future of certain printed magazines is called into question by the Internet.

For example, the Internet is already revolutionizing the exchange of specialized scientific information. Printed scientific journals tend to have small circulations, making them high-priced. University libraries are a big part of the market. It’s been an awkward, slow, expensive way to distribute information to a specialized audience, but there hasn’t been an alternative.

Now some researchers are beginning to use the Internet to publish scientific findings. The practice challenges the future of some venerable printed journals.

Over time, the breadth of information on the Internet will be enormous, which will make it compelling. Although the gold rush atmosphere today is primarily confined to the United States, I expect it to sweep the world as communications costs come down and a critical mass of localized content becomes available in different countries.

For the Internet to thrive, content providers must be paid for their work. The long-term prospects are good, but I expect a lot of disappointment in the short-term as content companies struggle to make money through advertising or subscriptions. It isn’t working yet, and it may not for some time.

So far, at least, most of the money and effort put into interactive publishing is little more than a labor of love, or an effort to help promote products sold in the non-electronic world. Often these efforts are based on the belief that over time someone will figure out how to get revenue.

In the long run, advertising is promising. An advantage of interactive advertising is that an initial message needs only to attract attention rather than convey much information. A user can click on the ad to get additional information-and an advertiser can measure whether people are doing so.

But today the amount of subscription revenue or advertising revenue realized on the Internet is near zero-maybe $20 million or $30 million in total. Advertisers are always a little reluctant about a new medium, and the Internet is certainly new and different.

Some reluctance on the part of advertisers may be justified, because many Internet users are less-than-thrilled about seeing advertising. One reason is that many advertisers use big images that take a long time to download across a telephone dial-up connection. A magazine ad takes up space too, but a reader can flip a printed page rapidly.

As connections to the Internet get faster, the annoyance of waiting for an advertisement to load will diminish and then disappear. But that’s a few years off.

Some content companies are experimenting with subscriptions, often with the lure of some free content. It’s tricky, though, because as soon as an electronic community charges a subscription, the number of people who visit the site drops dramatically, reducing the value proposition to advertisers.

A major reason paying for content doesn’t work very well yet is that it’s not practical to charge small amounts. The cost and hassle of electronic transactions makes it impractical to charge less than a fairly high subscription rate.

But within a year the mechanisms will be in place that allow content providers to charge just a cent or a few cents for information. If you decide to visit a page that costs a nickel, you won’t be writing a check or getting a bill in the mail for a nickel. You’ll just click on what you want, knowing you’ll be charged a nickel on an aggregated basis.

This technology will liberate publishers to charge small amounts of money, in the hope of attracting wide audiences.

Those who succeed will propel the Internet forward as a marketplace of ideas, experiences, and products-a marketplace of content.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="byline"><em>MAY 2001</em>
<em> </em><em>BY <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~hendler/">James Hendler</a> and <a href="http://www.lassila.org/">Ora Lassila</a></em></div>
The entertainment system was belting out the Beatles' "We Can Work It Out" when the phone rang. When Pete answered, his phone turned the sound down by sending a message to all the other <em>local</em> devices that had a <em>volume control</em>. His sister, Lucy, was on the line from the doctor's office: "Mom needs to see a specialist and then has to have a series of physical therapy sessions. Biweekly or something. I'm going to have my agent set up the appointments." Pete immediately agreed to share the chauffeuring.

At the doctor's office, Lucy instructed her Semantic Web agent through her handheld Web browser. The agent promptly retrieved information about Mom's<em> prescribed treatment</em> from the doctor's agent, looked up several lists of <em>providers</em>, and checked for the ones <em>in-plan</em> for Mom's insurance within a <em>20-mile radius</em> of her <em>home</em> and with a <em>rating</em> of <em>excellent</em> or <em>very good</em> on trusted rating services. It then began trying to find a match between available <em>appointment times</em> (supplied by the agents of individual providers through their Web sites) and Pete's and Lucy's busy schedules. (The emphasized keywords indicate terms whose semantics, or meaning, were defined for the agent through the Semantic Web.)

In a few minutes the agent presented them with a plan. Pete didn't like it¿University Hospital was all the way across town from Mom's place, and he'd be driving back in the middle of rush hour. He set his own agent to redo the search with stricter preferences about <em>location</em> and <em>time</em>. Lucy's agent, having <em>complete trust</em> in Pete's agent in the context of the present task, automatically assisted by supplying access certificates and shortcuts to the data it had already sorted through.

Almost instantly the new plan was presented: a much closer clinic and earlier times¿but there were two warning notes. First, Pete would have to reschedule a couple of his <em>less important</em> appointments. He checked what they were¿not a problem. The other was something about the insurance company's list failing to include this provider under <em>physical therapists</em>: "Service type and insurance plan status securely verified by other means," the agent reassured him. "(Details?)"

Lucy registered her assent at about the same moment Pete was muttering, "Spare me the details," and it was all set. (Of course, Pete couldn't resist the details and later that night had his agent explain how it had found that provider even though it wasn't on the proper list.)
<h2>Expressing Meaning</h2>
Pete and Lucy could use their agents to carry out all these tasks thanks not to the World Wide Web of today but rather the Semantic Web that it will evolve into tomorrow. Most of the Web's content today is designed for humans to read, not for computer programs to manipulate meaningfully. Computers can adeptly parse Web pages for layout and routine processing¿here a header, there a link to another page¿but in general, computers have no reliable way to process the semantics: this is the home page of the Hartman and Strauss Physio Clinic, this link goes to Dr. Hartman's curriculum vitae.

The Semantic Web will bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages, creating an environment where software agents roaming from page to page can readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users. Such an agent coming to the clinic's Web page will know not just that the page has keywords such as "treatment, medicine, physical, therapy" (as might be encoded today) but also that Dr. Hartman <em>works</em> at this <em>clinic</em> on <em>Mondays</em>, <em>Wednesdays</em> and <em>Fridays</em> and that the script takes a <em>date range</em> in <em>yyyy-mm-dd format</em> and returns <em>appointment times</em>. And it will "know" all this without needing artificial intelligence on the scale of 2001's Hal or Star Wars's C-3PO. Instead these semantics were encoded into the Web page when the clinic's office manager (who never took Comp Sci 101) massaged it into shape using off-the-shelf software for writing Semantic Web pages along with resources listed on the Physical Therapy Association's site.

The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. The first steps in weaving the Semantic Web into the structure of the existing Web are already under way. In the near future, these developments will usher in significant new functionality as machines become much better able to process and "understand" the data that they merely display at present.

The essential property of the World Wide Web is its universality. The power of a hypertext link is that "anything can link to anything." Web technology, therefore, must not discriminate between the scribbled draft and the polished performance, between commercial and academic information, or among cultures, languages, media and so on. Information varies along many axes. One of these is the difference between information produced primarily for human consumption and that produced mainly for machines. At one end of the scale we have everything from the five-second TV commercial to poetry. At the other end we have databases, programs and sensor output. To date, the Web has developed most rapidly as a medium of documents for people rather than for data and information that can be processed automatically. The Semantic Web aims to make up for this.

Like the Internet, the Semantic Web will be as decentralized as possible. Such Web-like systems generate a lot of excitement at every level, from major corporation to individual user, and provide benefits that are hard or impossible to predict in advance. Decentralization requires compromises: the Web had to throw away the ideal of total consistency of all of its interconnections, ushering in the infamous message "Error 404: Not Found" but allowing unchecked exponential growth.
<h2>Knowledge Representation</h2>
For the semantic web to function, computers must have access to structured collections of information and sets of inference rules that they can use to conduct automated reasoning. Artificial-intelligence researchers have studied such systems since long before the Web was developed. Knowledge representation, as this technology is often called, is currently in a state comparable to that of hypertext before the advent of the Web: it is clearly a good idea, and some very nice demonstrations exist, but it has not yet changed the world. It contains the seeds of important applications, but to realize its full potential it must be linked into a single global system.

Traditional knowledge-representation systems typically have been centralized, requiring everyone to share exactly the same definition of common concepts such as "parent" or "vehicle." But central control is stifling, and increasing the size and scope of such a system rapidly becomes unmanageable.

Moreover, these systems usually carefully limit the questions that can be asked so that the computer can answer reliably¿ or answer at all. The problem is reminiscent of Godel's theorem from mathematics: any system that is complex enough to be useful also encompasses unanswerable questions, much like sophisticated versions of the basic paradox "This sentence is false." To avoid such problems, traditional knowledge-representation systems generally each had their own narrow and idiosyncratic set of rules for making inferences about their data. For example, a genealogy system, acting on a database of family trees, might include the rule "a wife of an uncle is an aunt." Even if the data could be transferred from one system to another, the rules, existing in a completely different form, usually could not.

Semantic Web researchers, in contrast, accept that paradoxes and unanswerable questions are a price that must be paid to achieve versatility. We make the language for the rules as expressive as needed to allow the Web to reason as widely as desired. This philosophy is similar to that of the conventional Web: early in the Web's development, detractors pointed out that it could never be a well-organized library; without a central database and tree structure, one would never be sure of finding everything. They were right. But the expressive power of the system made vast amounts of information available, and search engines (which would have seemed quite impractical a decade ago) now produce remarkably complete indices of a lot of the material out there. The challenge of the Semantic Web, therefore, is to provide a language that expresses both data and rules for reasoning about the data and that allows rules from any existing knowledge-representation system to be exported onto the Web.

Adding logic to the Web¿the means to use rules to make inferences, choose courses of action and answer questions¿is the task before the Semantic Web community at the moment. A mixture of mathematical and engineering decisions complicate this task. The logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. Fortunately, a large majority of the information we want to express is along the lines of "a hex-head bolt is a type of machine bolt," which is readily written in existing languages with a little extra vocabulary.

Two important technologies for developing the Semantic Web are already in place: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). XML lets everyone create their own tags¿hidden labels such as or that annotate Web pages or sections of text on a page. Scripts, or programs, can make use of these tags in sophisticated ways, but the script writer has to know what the page writer uses each tag for. In short, XML allows users to add arbitrary structure to their documents but says nothing about what the structures mean.

The Semantic Web will enable machines to COMPREHEND semantic documents and data, not human speech and writings.

<hr noshade="noshade" size="2" />

Meaning is expressed by RDF, which encodes it in sets of triples, each triple being rather like the subject, verb and object of an elementary sentence. These triples can be written using XML tags. In RDF, a document makes assertions that particular things (people, Web pages or whatever) have properties (such as "is a sister of," "is the author of") with certain values (another person, another Web page). This structure turns out to be a natural way to describe the vast majority of the data processed by machines. Subject and object are each identified by a Universal Resource Identifier (URI), just as used in a link on a Web page. (URLs, Uniform Resource Locators, are the most common type of URI.) The verbs are also identified by URIs, which enables anyone to define a new concept, a new verb, just by defining a URI for it somewhere on the Web.

Human language thrives when using the same term to mean somewhat different things, but automation does not. Imagine that I hire a clown messenger service to deliver balloons to my customers on their birthdays. Unfortunately, the service transfers the addresses from my database to its database, not knowing that the "addresses" in mine are where bills are sent and that many of them are post office boxes. My hired clowns end up entertaining a number of postal workers¿not necessarily a bad thing but certainly not the intended effect. Using a different URI for each specific concept solves that problem. An address that is a mailing address can be distinguished from one that is a street address, and both can be distinguished from an address that is a speech.

The triples of RDF form webs of information about related things. Because RDF uses URIs to encode this information in a document, the URIs ensure that concepts are not just words in a document but are tied to a unique definition that everyone can find on the Web. For example, imagine that we have access to a variety of databases with information about people, including their addresses. If we want to find people living in a specific zip code, we need to know which fields in each database represent names and which represent zip codes. RDF can specify that "(field 5 in database A) (is a field of type) (zip code)," using URIs rather than phrases for each term.
<h2>Ontologies</h2>
Of course, this is not the end of the story, because two databases may use different identifiers for what is in fact the same concept, such as <em>zip code</em>. A program that wants to compare or combine information across the two databases has to know that these two terms are being used to mean the same thing. Ideally, the program must have a way to discover such common meanings for whatever databases it encounters.

A solution to this problem is provided by the third basic component of the Semantic Web, collections of information called ontologies. In philosophy, an ontology is a theory about the nature of existence, of what types of things exist; ontology as a discipline studies such theories. Artificial-intelligence and Web researchers have co-opted the term for their own jargon, and for them an ontology is a document or file that formally defines the relations among terms. The most typical kind of ontology for the Web has a taxonomy and a set of inference rules.

The taxonomy defines classes of objects and relations among them. For example, an <em>address</em> may be defined as a type of <em>location</em>, and<em>city codes</em> may be defined to apply only to <em>locations</em>, and so on. Classes, subclasses and relations among entities are a very powerful tool for Web use. We can express a large number of relations among entities by assigning properties to classes and allowing subclasses to inherit such properties. If <em>city codes</em> must be of type <em>city</em> and cities generally have Web sites, we can discuss the Web site associated with a <em>city code</em> even if no database links a city code directly to a Web site.

Inference rules in ontologies supply further power. An ontology may express the rule "If a city code is associated with a state code, and an address uses that city code, then that address has the associated state code." A program could then readily deduce, for instance, that a Cornell University address, being in Ithaca, must be in New York State, which is in the U.S., and therefore should be formatted to U.S. standards. The computer doesn't truly "understand" any of this information, but it can now manipulate the terms much more effectively in ways that are useful and meaningful to the human user.

With ontology pages on the Web, solutions to terminology (and other) problems begin to emerge. The meaning of terms or XML codes used on a Web page can be defined by pointers from the page to an ontology. Of course, the same problems as before now arise if I point to an ontology that defines <em>addresses</em> as containing a <em>zip code</em> and you point to one that uses <em>postal code</em>. This kind of confusion can be resolved if ontologies (or other Web services) provide equivalence relations: one or both of our ontologies may contain the information that my zip code is equivalent to your postal code.

Our scheme for sending in the clowns to entertain my customers is partially solved when the two databases point to different definitions of <em>address</em>. The program, using distinct URIs for different concepts of address, will not confuse them and in fact will need to discover that the concepts are related at all. The program could then use a service that takes a list of <em>postal addresses</em> (defined in the first ontology) and converts it into a list of physical <em>addresses</em> (the second ontology) by recognizing and removing post office boxes and other unsuitable addresses. The structure and semantics provided by ontologies make it easier for an entrepreneur to provide such a service and can make its use completely transparent.

Ontologies can enhance the functioning of the Web in many ways. They can be used in a simple fashion to improve the accuracy of Web searches¿the search program can look for only those pages that refer to a precise concept instead of all the ones using ambiguous keywords. More advanced applications will use ontologies to relate the information on a page to the associated knowledge structures and inference rules. An example of a page marked up for such use is online at http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hendler. If you send your Web browser to that page, you will see the normal Web page entitled "Dr. James A. Hendler." As a human, you can readily find the link to a short biographical note and read there that Hendler received his Ph.D. from Brown University. A computer program trying to find such information, however, would have to be very complex to guess that this information might be in a biography and to understand the English language used there.

For computers, the page is linked to an ontology page that defines information about computer science departments. For instance, professors work at universities and they generally have doctorates. Further markup on the page (not displayed by the typical Web browser) uses the ontology's concepts to specify that Hendler received his Ph.D. from the entity described at the URI http://www. brown.edu ¿ the Web page for Brown. Computers can also find that Hendler is a member of a particular research project, has a particular e-mail address, and so on. All that information is readily processed by a computer and could be used to answer queries (such as where Dr. Hendler received his degree) that currently would require a human to sift through the content of various pages turned up by a search engine.

In addition, this markup makes it much easier to develop programs that can tackle complicated questions whose answers do not reside on a single Web page. Suppose you wish to find the Ms. Cook you met at a trade conference last year. You don't remember her first name, but you remember that she worked for one of your clients and that her son was a student at your alma mater. An intelligent search program can sift through all the pages of people whose name is "Cook" (sidestepping all the pages relating to cooks, cooking, the Cook Islands and so forth), find the ones that mention working for a company that's on your list of clients and follow links to Web pages of their children to track down if any are in school at the right place.
<h2>Agents</h2>
The real power of the Semantic Web will be realized when people create many programs that collect Web content from diverse sources, process the information and exchange the results with other programs. The effectiveness of such software agents will increase exponentially as more machine-readable Web content and automated services (including other agents) become available. The Semantic Web promotes this synergy: even agents that were not expressly designed to work together can transfer data among themselves when the data come with semantics.

An important facet of agents' functioning will be the exchange of "proofs" written in the Semantic Web's unifying language (the language that expresses logical inferences made using rules and information such as those specified by ontologies). For example, suppose Ms. Cook's contact information has been located by an online service, and to your great surprise it places her in Johannesburg. Naturally, you want to check this, so your computer asks the service for a proof of its answer, which it promptly provides by translating its internal reasoning into the Semantic Web's unifying language. An inference engine in your computer readily verifies that this Ms. Cook indeed matches the one you were seeking, and it can show you the relevant Web pages if you still have doubts. Although they are still far from plumbing the depths of the Semantic Web's potential, some programs can already exchange proofs in this way, using the current preliminary versions of the unifying language.

Another vital feature will be digital signatures, which are encrypted blocks of data that computers and agents can use to verify that the attached information has been provided by a specific trusted source. You want to be quite sure that a statement sent to your accounting program that you owe money to an online retailer is not a forgery generated by the computer-savvy teenager next door. Agents should be skeptical of assertions that they read on the Semantic Web until they have checked the sources of information. (We wish more <em>people</em> would learn to do this on the Web as it is!)

Many automated Web-based services already exist without semantics, but other programs such as agents have no way to locate one that will perform a specific function. This process, called service discovery, can happen only when there is a common language to describe a service in a way that lets other agents "understand" both the function offered and how to take advantage of it. Services and agents can advertise their function by, for example, depositing such descriptions in directories analogous to the Yellow Pages.

Some low-level service-discovery schemes are currently available, such as Microsoft's Universal Plug and Play, which focuses on connecting different types of devices, and Sun Microsystems's Jini, which aims to connect services. These initiatives, however, attack the problem at a structural or syntactic level and rely heavily on standardization of a predetermined set of functionality descriptions. Standardization can only go so far, because we can't anticipate all possible future needs.

The Semantic Web, in contrast, is more flexible. The consumer and producer agents can reach a shared understanding by exchanging ontologies, which provide the vocabulary needed for discussion. Agents can even "bootstrap" new reasoning capabilities when they discover new ontologies. Semantics also makes it easier to take advantage of a service that only partially matches a request.

A typical process will involve the creation of a "value chain" in which subassemblies of information are passed from one agent to another, each one "adding value," to construct the final product requested by the end user. Make no mistake: to create complicated value chains automatically on demand, some agents will exploit artificial-intelligence technologies in addition to the Semantic Web. But the Semantic Web will provide the foundations and the framework to make such technologies more feasible.

Putting all these features together results in the abilities exhibited by Pete's and Lucy's agents in the scenario that opened this article. Their agents would have delegated the task in piecemeal fashion to other services and agents discovered through service advertisements. For example, they could have used a <em>trusted</em> service to take a list of <em>providers</em> and determine which of them are <em>in-plan</em> for a specified <em>insurance plan</em> and <em>course of treatment</em>. The list of providers would have been supplied by another search service, et cetera. These activities formed chains in which a large amount of data distributed across the Web (and almost worthless in that form) was progressively reduced to the small amount of data of high value to Pete and Lucy¿a plan of appointments to fit their schedules and other requirements.

In the next step, the Semantic Web will break out of the virtual realm and extend into our physical world. URIs can point to anything, including physical entities, which means we can use the RDF language to describe devices such as cell phones and TVs. Such devices can advertise their functionality¿what they can do and how they are controlled¿much like software agents. Being much more flexible than low-level schemes such as Universal Plug and Play, such a semantic approach opens up a world of exciting possibilities.

For instance, what today is called home automation requires careful configuration for appliances to work together. Semantic descriptions of device capabilities and functionality will let us achieve such automation with minimal human intervention. A trivial example occurs when Pete answers his phone and the stereo sound is turned down. Instead of having to program each specific appliance, he could program such a function once and for all to cover every <em>local</em> device that advertises having a <em>volume control</em> ¿ the TV, the DVD player and even the media players on the laptop that he brought home from work this one evening.

The first concrete steps have already been taken in this area, with work on developing a standard for describing functional capabilities of devices (such as screen sizes) and user preferences. Built on RDF, this standard is called Composite Capability/Preference Profile (CC/PP). Initially it will let cell phones and other nonstandard Web clients describe their characteristics so that Web content can be tailored for them on the fly. Later, when we add the full versatility of languages for handling ontologies and logic, devices could automatically seek out and employ services and other devices for added information or functionality. It is not hard to imagine your Web-enabled microwave oven consulting the frozen-food manufacturer's Web site for optimal cooking parameters.
<h2>Evolution of Knowledge</h2>
The semantic web is not "merely" the tool for conducting individual tasks that we have discussed so far. In addition, if properly designed, the Semantic Web can assist the evolution of human knowledge as a whole.

Human endeavor is caught in an eternal tension between the effectiveness of small groups acting independently and the need to mesh with the wider community. A small group can innovate rapidly and efficiently, but this produces a subculture whose concepts are not understood by others. Coordinating actions across a large group, however, is painfully slow and takes an enormous amount of communication. The world works across the spectrum between these extremes, with a tendency to start small¿from the personal idea¿and move toward a wider understanding over time.

An essential process is the joining together of subcultures when a wider common language is needed. Often two groups independently develop very similar concepts, and describing the relation between them brings great benefits. Like a Finnish-English dictionary, or a weights-and-measures conversion table, the relations allow communication and collaboration even when the commonality of concept has not (yet) led to a commonality of terms.

The Semantic Web, in naming every concept simply by a URI, lets anyone express new concepts that they invent with minimal effort. Its unifying logical language will enable these concepts to be progressively linked into a universal Web. This structure will open up the knowledge and workings of humankind to meaningful analysis by software agents, providing a new class of tools by which we can live, work and learn together.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Content is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting.

The television revolution that began half a century ago spawned a number of industries, including the manufacturing of TV sets, but the long-term winners were those who used the medium to deliver information and entertainment.

When it comes to an interactive network such as the Internet, the definition of “content” becomes very wide. For example, computer software is a form of content-an extremely important one, and the one that for Microsoft will remain by far the most important.

But the broad opportunities for most companies involve supplying information or entertainment. No company is too small to participate.

One of the exciting things about the Internet is that anyone with a PC and a modem can publish whatever content they can create. In a sense, the Internet is the multimedia equivalent of the photocopier. It allows material to be duplicated at low cost, no matter the size of the audience.

The Internet also allows information to be distributed worldwide at basically zero marginal cost to the publisher. Opportunities are remarkable, and many companies are laying plans to create content for the Internet.

For example, the television network NBC and Microsoft recently agreed to enter the interactive news business together. Our companies will jointly own a cable news network, MSNBC, and an interactive news service on the Internet. NBC will maintain editorial control over the joint venture.

I expect societies will see intense competition-and ample failure as well as success-in all categories of popular content-not just software and news, but also games, entertainment, sports programming, directories, classified advertising, and on-line communities devoted to major interests.

Printed magazines have readerships that share common interests. It’s easy to imagine these communities being served by electronic online editions.

But to be successful online, a magazine can’t just take what it has in print and move it to the electronic realm. There isn’t enough depth or interactivity in print content to overcome the drawbacks of the online medium.

If people are to be expected to put up with turning on a computer to read a screen, they must be rewarded with deep and extremely up-to-date information that they can explore at will. They need to have audio, and possibly video. They need an opportunity for personal involvement that goes far beyond that offered through the letters-to-the-editor pages of print magazines.

A question on many minds is how often the same company that serves an interest group in print will succeed in serving it online. Even the very future of certain printed magazines is called into question by the Internet.

For example, the Internet is already revolutionizing the exchange of specialized scientific information. Printed scientific journals tend to have small circulations, making them high-priced. University libraries are a big part of the market. It’s been an awkward, slow, expensive way to distribute information to a specialized audience, but there hasn’t been an alternative.

Now some researchers are beginning to use the Internet to publish scientific findings. The practice challenges the future of some venerable printed journals.

Over time, the breadth of information on the Internet will be enormous, which will make it compelling. Although the gold rush atmosphere today is primarily confined to the United States, I expect it to sweep the world as communications costs come down and a critical mass of localized content becomes available in different countries.

For the Internet to thrive, content providers must be paid for their work. The long-term prospects are good, but I expect a lot of disappointment in the short-term as content companies struggle to make money through advertising or subscriptions. It isn’t working yet, and it may not for some time.

So far, at least, most of the money and effort put into interactive publishing is little more than a labor of love, or an effort to help promote products sold in the non-electronic world. Often these efforts are based on the belief that over time someone will figure out how to get revenue.

In the long run, advertising is promising. An advantage of interactive advertising is that an initial message needs only to attract attention rather than convey much information. A user can click on the ad to get additional information-and an advertiser can measure whether people are doing so.

But today the amount of subscription revenue or advertising revenue realized on the Internet is near zero-maybe $20 million or $30 million in total. Advertisers are always a little reluctant about a new medium, and the Internet is certainly new and different.

Some reluctance on the part of advertisers may be justified, because many Internet users are less-than-thrilled about seeing advertising. One reason is that many advertisers use big images that take a long time to download across a telephone dial-up connection. A magazine ad takes up space too, but a reader can flip a printed page rapidly.

As connections to the Internet get faster, the annoyance of waiting for an advertisement to load will diminish and then disappear. But that’s a few years off.

Some content companies are experimenting with subscriptions, often with the lure of some free content. It’s tricky, though, because as soon as an electronic community charges a subscription, the number of people who visit the site drops dramatically, reducing the value proposition to advertisers.

A major reason paying for content doesn’t work very well yet is that it’s not practical to charge small amounts. The cost and hassle of electronic transactions makes it impractical to charge less than a fairly high subscription rate.

But within a year the mechanisms will be in place that allow content providers to charge just a cent or a few cents for information. If you decide to visit a page that costs a nickel, you won’t be writing a check or getting a bill in the mail for a nickel. You’ll just click on what you want, knowing you’ll be charged a nickel on an aggregated basis.

This technology will liberate publishers to charge small amounts of money, in the hope of attracting wide audiences.

Those who succeed will propel the Internet forward as a marketplace of ideas, experiences, and products-a marketplace of content.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Metonymy as an Approach to a Real World
Whether what we sense of this world
is the what of this world only, or the what
of which of several possible worlds
–which what?–something of what we sense
may be true, may be the world, what it is, what we sense.
For the rest, a truce is possible, the tolerance
of travelers, eating foreign foods, trying words
that twist the tongue, to feel that time and place,
not thinking that this is the real world.

Conceded, that all the clocks tell local time;
conceded, that “here” is anywhere we bound
and fill a space; conceded, we make a world:
is something caught there, contained there,
something real, something which we can sense?
Once in a city blocked and filled, I saw
the light lie in the deep chasm of a street,
palpable and blue, as though it had drifted in
from say, the sea, a purity of space.
– William Bronk]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Caveat: This needs serious work. Perhaps I will revise these “claims”, without doing too much damage to their thrust, in 10 years (or tomorrow).
2009
1. A poem is a collection of misunderstood lines which jostle for attention like children at a party. The noisome distraction is the rest of the page.

2. When I rest there comes my best philosophizing. But I am unsure whether these were nightmares.

3. The religious man has everything to fear from his kin and nothing from the atheist. When will be the day that we pity the atheist?

4. I have several thoughts which rush at me during the day-to-day; I cannot determine which of them are philosophical and which of them are sorrows.

5. They confuse us with Philosophers. It matters indeed what we call things.

6. “Solve this puzzle. Now this. Now that.” The puzzle is why I must  use quotes.

7. Religion as a lifeless body of propositions. Perhaps our first step is a fallacy.

8. “Mind your matters.” The neuroscientist is at war with a harmless idiom. It was rightly said that science has no other more significant, underpinning principle.

9. Science knows no better enemy than simplicity.

10. The only proof is that I stand here before you.

11. Write with a seriousness about you, one that is convincing. That is your best argument, and it carries with it all that it will need.

12. Morality has a logical form, one of which I have a knack for ignoring before all others.

13. We must admit that our problem is difficult before we can admit that we have a problem. Admittance is a rare talent.

14. I’ve always wondered which box they’re talking about.

15. Let’s argue over which adjective is best to use.

16. The Supreme Normative Principle of Morality: Make it seem as if you are making argument. When you read a Classic, look for the trick.

17. The philosopher becomes a social anthropologist. “You’ve shed light on your model, your methodology, not on the problem, for I have rejected that there is a problem. This is a philosophical background check. It began when you introduced your first normative claim.”

18. The concept of “intellectual property” (and more generally, perhaps, “property”) is a remnant of superstition and is highly religious in character. It is a manifestation of the capitalist’s belief in life after death, a commonality with the spiritual or the religious. When X dies, the statement “X owns Y” remains true–a rather oddity. Which other similarities can we expose, between law and religion, capitalism and religion?

19. Our anachronistic tendency is perhaps justified. Too often am I mistaken for a historian.

20. The pessimist: Performance is a good indication of competence.
The behaviorist: Performance is the only indication of competence.

21. I frequently get the eerie feeling that the locutions are my terms.

22. A question is valid only under a certain setting.

23. Proof is unnecessary if rule calls for its self-evidence.

24. By “complex” we mean high up, and by “simple” we mean what is plain. Truth is all about moving across the smoothest plane imaginable.

25. When it comes down to it, ridicule is the easiest but most illuminating refutation. Track the line of ridicule, and you shall witness the history of ideas properly.

26. The habit of theory building. So too must the rest of me be of equal importance, from toe to the trembling before my reflection.

27. A gaze becomes vacant once a thought enters.

28. Ne jamais sortez du lit avant midi.

29. Game Show Ethics. There must be an absurdity in Socrates’ method writ large.

30. The dialectic is an excuse for being ignorant. We cannot stop the convergence of games.

31. Concision is concession when in solitude. On the other hand–outward, it is understood that at a certain point we must learn to be precise. Precision is the gauge on which we judge one another. No higher respect can be paid to a philosopher. Though, I still lack the tools to spot a flagrant gloss.

32. We cannot be naive in our treatment of language-games. Their content is worthy of no respect by us, but their form is captivating.

33. Lights are eyesores on the night.

34. ?x(Sbx?-Sxx)–there’s something Aristotelian about it. A denial of the logical type “humanity,” to speak in those Russellian terms. To go further: A symbolism can have no meaning, a logic no content. But even further, the problem concerns the constitution of a rule. A role, a function, one dimensional procedure, linear, definition. Give the barber a “pure” character within the game, and we shall forget that he is organic.

35. Nihilists walk amongst us. The determining ground for faith is one’s capacity to accept coincidence. How might this capacity demonstrate itself publicly.

36. As philosophers it becomes instinct to reject the mythical noun, or it should be instinct. Its precondition takes the count-noun, given an indeterminate quantity. At a certain point, the mythical noun creeps into the grammar of the culture by way of shorthand or decadence or self-taught limit or perhaps pity for the Self; then predication of it becomes grammatical by mere use. The point is then reached where we can call it a convention of that culture.

37. The distinction between religious behavior and moral behavior. He looks religious, but looks at the same time immoral. Does religious behavior imply moral properties at all?

38. A child at a church service or at the playground looks to his parent and asks that kind of question. The parent dismisses the child’s inquiry as nonsense, infantile philosophizing or timewasting. The parent simply has not the energy to devote to such a line of inquiry which obviously misapplies terms while a sincerity looms. The child wishes to be answered appropriately. What is the appropriate response? What is the child truly after?–The child, in learning and growing, is drowned in a waterfall of terms, phrase, idiom, metaphor, analogy, facon de parler, jargon, modal expressions of (superficially) incommensurable language games, poetic license, and so forth. Imagine a community in which the language employed by its members is in every respect similar to your own, but only the vocabulary has been shifted slightly. “Tree” refers to something other than is the norm with respect to your language, “House” to something other, and so on. How might you go about learning the language with sincerity and child-like energy? At what point will the members of that community call you a “skeptic”? Will you, in effect, find yourself engaging in metaphysical questions? Questioning the ontology of that community? Or will you merely find it perplexing that so many terms have shifted? You will say, “Look, look, I have begun this categorization procedure. I think I am quite on the right track. All these nouns are related thus, all these verbs fall under the same general case.” But then someone will, by happenstance, suggest a new noun which is peculiar to the rest, outside of simply being novel to you. Then many persons will do the same with such a noun, and you will seek to understand why the noun is used in such a way while not used in others. Your child-like questioning will then appear like a thesis or a position about the things in question. Your questioning will appear ontological in nature, for it will be presumed, after some time, that you have some mastery of the language. But at what point have you become master? What does it mean to call you this? So for a child, is the child seeking guidance for a position? Is the child seeking instruction on some doctrine? Correct of his doctrine? Or is the child merely confused about the nature of so many nouns and phrase, seeking guidance as to why one noun fits while another does not? Is the child inquiring, or is the child a constraint for that which counts as grammatical? But the adult may use expression and phrase similar to the child; the adult’s proposition may be construed as a question about the use of a term.

39. “Well, if we all agree about it, won’t it be true? (I cannot accept someone else’s testimony, because it is not testimony. It only tells me what he is inclined to say.)” (LW) My emphasis. Now consider religious testimony, scientific… Under a system, how might I distinguish the significant proposition from the determined proposition? How might I justify that there is a distinction to be had at all? What about when significant propositions between systems overlap, intrude, infiltrate? Philosophy is not a game unto itself, and neither is any other discourse. But my conception of this or that discourse delimits my propensity to say, “Ah, yes, that is a profound consideration. A profound idea indeed!”

40. A friend N. tells me, “But sometimes my language is insufficient; it does not harness the thought I wish to convey.” To which I replied, “But is language the culprit?” “Not solely the culprit, no.” But what should he wish to say. Do we have a dilemma or not?

41. My conscience informs me of my values thus… Are these orders? Imperatives? How might I order myself?–”Remember your values.” That is, recall how you typically behave.

42. “I wish to tell you…” But you cannot know what is to be known unless caused by my words in the right way. How might you know nevertheless?

43. We tend to intuit the “intuition” of the other.

44. If morality has a grammar, then surely I could learn it, more or less; but why should I? A different issue: “Surely I should learn it.” And now we face a new perspective. Our question takes on a new antagonism: a duality of what it means to be a “learner.”

45. If I question you at all, might you consider me to be questioning you in a particular way? No question has a character of its own; every question is at the same time a presumption. “Might the behavior be so?”–”You question the principles of our method!” “Might I do it later?”–”You question the principles of my standard!” “Could I follow you thus?”–”But we have a determined plan.” We could construe any conception, any volitional posture, as a principle from which one acts; but cynicism comes in the presumption of there being not principle to impose one’s self. No principle is an immobile fortress, though it is embedded.

46. We say of the ‘amoralist’: he is nothing more than your posit with which to bother the foundations of home. The presumption is that amoralism exists only in the classroom setting. What a convenient presumption! It takes much legwork to get to a fair and even footing.

47. Ridicule is an art form and the greatest intellectual achievement. Surprising is it that it should not be listed amongst the greatest features of immorality; but it flies unscathed while we target “murder,” “injustice,” “atheism”…

48. We should wish to say not that the neuroscientist is false in his claim, but that he cannot possibly wish to mean what his utterance implies. A mistake into senselessness. A mistake often unseen. The illusion of sense is predicated on the illusion of grammaticality. If only to be grammatical were the extent of our purpose, but it is funny that they should reduce sense and significant assertion to be sufficiently made by grammaticality alone. The moralist claims, “Obey the law!” To which one replies, “But it is legal!”

49. It is a proposition, or a set of, which can intelligibly be said to be absolutist or Platonist or realist; while it may be said that this man or that woman that they are convicted or dogmatic or, in a particular sense, naïve. The former may be said or held in conjunction truly or falsely, while the latter may simply not. Where, and under which circumstances or conditions, might we see the mistake of mixing these categories, where a juggernaut conviction is mistaken for an absolutist position? Where a naïve question is painted before one’s mind as unnecessarily one of naïve realism?

50. To accept, and fully understand, the private language argument is to follow an instinct; and to not is to not have that instinct.

51. The Philosopher asks, “Is that beauty, that aesthetic value contained, as it were, within the piece (this piece or that work or that sculpture) objective?” The denizen of the street might find this question peculiar in that it seems prima facie that this term “objective” has been let off its leash. But that is not the only problem, for the Grammarian notes what the street intimates: “There is a relation between the terms ‘objective’ and ‘beauty’. Objective, to be fair, is a kind of abstract quality that a thing may have, but a quality (in a strong sense, the Philosopher’s sense) nevertheless. And note, so too is “beauty,” though an abstract quality but only w/r/t, say, a particular texture of a brush stroke. (One says, that brush stroke is beautiful–something more abstract in relation to crude strokes or nevertheless precise, trained pen, for “beauty” on most accounts intimates the belief that the “organization” in which the stroke or line inheres makes the stroke or line the complex, representational, symbolic move that it is. “Ah yes, that part of the artwork (the whole) is symbolic. So too, the work is itself, as a whole, symbolic; but there is a relation between these two symbols.” Does the former constitute the latter?) But as abstracts concepts, “beauty” and “objective” seem to be at odds. Nevertheless the Philosopher plays her trick: “Is beauty objective?” (Notice the distinction between this question and our original, now the similarities. Are there any to speak of?) But we as Grammarians attempt a significance: “Look, if we both understand what is meant to be said by ‘such-and-such is beautiful’, then it must be understand that I cannot answer affirmatively to the original question. By ‘beauty’ I permit that it could not have been beautiful. To be beautiful is to be so in virtue of the non-objective presentation of that which I judge; little needs to be said that its constitution is essentially contingent.” So might the latter Philosophical question be asked at all? Whether beauty be a Form or a inter-subjective standard, a convention, the question is clearly ill-formed, for no one buys the Forms (my argument is that I nudge you and ask, “Do you really believe that? Eh? Eh?–whatever your Platonic bearings and conception or rendition be) and surely to presume a meaning by convention presuppositions the answer which is to be sought by the Philosopher. But what is the philosopher indeed doing? Clearly if all he wishes to do is play with symbols in the Possibly Most Abstract, a nightmarish logic ensures: The worst kind of nightmare is one which consists of no pictures, no sensibility, no sensation, for pictures, images, with meaning, give the nightmare its life. But a “nightmare” professedly claimed by some patron–perhaps God–that consists of no imagery, nothing graphical? A blurry nightmare is at least a blur; we might say “at least it was just a blur” or “yes, the blur frightens me so.” But a void nightmare with no leaning to the positive or the negative is the worst of all.

52. The tendency to let commendation describe. The decadent man says, “It is good.” In conversation, the pauses between acts of speech are important. They imply form. Remember: Lexicography is a science. How peculiar to think: Dictionaries are approximations to sense. Well, think: brute fact and institutional fact, brute sense and institutional sense. Now we see the motivation for the logical grammarian. A dictionary is no guarantor of sense.

53. The world: An utterance may realize for its speaker esteem or it may realize gross ridicule. There is something mysterious about contextualist viewpoints, motivations; we distance ourselves wholly from the anthropologist, from the historian, from the physical scientist. What is the “contextualist”? Is she simply that which conjoins us to our “others”? Why did contextualist defusal of radical doubt become a convention (custom)?

54. The motivation behind formality and rigor. There is a binding between it and truth or there is not. Many of us, perhaps those oriented by postmodern condition, deny it to be so. Has professionalism any ontological commitment? But the tick of rigor denies that we can speak clearly while we speak so broadly. Yet the presumption of the former seems so flagrantly pragmatic. The spiral is nevertheless motivated.

55. The animal has nothing more than recognitional capacities. So, we train them. But if you poise a philosophical squint, a harmless “shift,” you get a poetry: Perhaps the non-human animal trains the human. He stands and shouts, “Sit!” He raises his arms, and again. He gestures this way and that, and again. Frustration follows. Then he learns; he begins to attenuate his tone but determines his method to a form–“One must command ‘Sit’ with force but not aggression.” The finesse of this contrasted with the precision of a dog’s posture.

56. Ontological commitment: every noun names an entity. What counts as “entity”? Does process philosophy get us past our original paradox?

57. Gettier problems are always clever and, perhaps, only superficially dubious in their construction. Our epistemologies must overcome human creativity to invent novel cases. What a standard we set for ourselves! This is the motivation behind the disdain for the Gettier problem, the motivation connected with speaking of now being at a “post-Gettier” phase.

58. Epistemic minimalism: Remember the richness of belief! We must ask: What in fact counts as a belief? We cannot untie ourselves from views of normative belief formation.

59. Even supposing that there are any, and this we certainly must suppose, for it is possible if not likely that they be hidden from us, an objective truth does not entail that one’s procedure in obtaining it is objective. Nothing prevents or precludes the possibility that one may stumble into an objective truth, either at the street corner or in the laboratory or during a passionate and sensual experience. A scientist or a lawyer, in the deep and sweat of their messy profession, may happily admit to you that they aim at an ideal procedure — if they have the time and energy and capacity to speak sincerely yet intelligibly to you about it at all. This embodies the background of discovery — what makes discovery in science so awesome, “meaningful.” (The suggestion that the world as it actually is is more beautiful and inspiring than we can imagine it.) It is a discovery precisely because it took us this long. And this is what philosophy must lack: We mustn’t treat the philosopher as if she we a scientist, toiling away for millennia — just imagine how shocking her discovery will be! (We must put an end to the conflation of science and philosophy; it is an unfortunate and dangerous picture. Notice: The philosopher will happily describe to you her procedure.) And the scientist?: Ever does the feeling loom that this or that article is the mysterious, not the aim of it, its claim, its hypothesis, its evidence, its conclusion. The procedure, the scientific method behind what is expressed, concerns me. How faulty is the presumpion: If you stand where I stand, and nothing more is required, you will reach my conclusion. (The principle of objectivity: What does it mean to “stand in the same place”?) That we should seek objective truths cannot be of itself an objective truth. (Williams)


60. Subjectivism about morality: The anthropologist’s heresy or an ignorance as to the nature of moral disagreement.

61. Scientists who lament for having not the capacity to use language to express their ideas are broken bones improperly healed.

62. As if finding a thing implies that one was searching for that thing. The object and method of science, as is presupposed, are never disjoined. A reduction of the meaning in the face of obvious multiplicity.

63. L.W. decries, “…the mistake in the set-theoretical approach consists time and again in treating laws and enumerations (lists) as essentially the same kind of thing” (PG 461) . A list may be a product of a law or not (it is not a list of that particular law). But can it be a list under no law? I write down an ordered-looking arrangement of things. What condition must be met for us to infer a rule? Or do we infer rules at all? Is it the (criterio)logical ground for the rule? Or is it an inductive ground? In any event: A list and a listing. The prescriptivist laments that the ordinary use these interchangeably, or in some cases where the other properly applies. A rule or principle is neither; however, we might say what it yields is a listing. And as a listing we might judge (infer?) that as such it must correspond to a list. Each thing yielded from the rule is a list or a listing. If it is simple, then it is a listing. If it is complex, then it is a list. A law does not end but that which it yields has an ending. Each thing produced by it will be simple or complex, which consists of simples. The irrational number has no end; but that which is written down from the rule is not itself the rule (a totality). Recall: what presents itself is one; what presents itself is multiple. The law is the former clause whereas the expression of the law is the latter.

64. Old thought: the foundation (philosophical roots) of mathematics is the activity of mathematicians.

65. I am in agreement with L.W. that an irrational is a procedure, a technique, a rule. Each yield is an expression its existence, in a way. In the way same, I suppose, that punishment in law, at least, in some cases, is an indication of moral orientation, moral law. Of course, punishment does not explain entirely the basis for moral law. In this same way, no yield of the rule of an irrational properly represents — they are substantives in different ways. How might I say “my moral code tells me it must be this way” to the skeptic? I might simply say it: And how would the skeptic respond? I see it and hear it everywhere: “Morality tells me to…” “? tells me to…” But for morality, do I say “But I cannot?” (( A parallel between “human limitation in mathematics” and the debate between “ought implies can”. )) We see that we ought to be able (in principle) to “complete” ? — or at least God could. We ought to do such-and-such, or, at least, we can.

66.  A kind of discovery? I have drawn a parallel between “ought implies can” (morality) and “we could [complete] the decimal expansion (in principle; or at least God could”. Very frequently do I find morality in mathematics, but I find it difficult to say exactly the commonality.

67. If an irrational is a “rule” or a “procedure”, then perhaps shares the logical feature of imperatives. But what is it about imperatives that make them “stick” to the emotion, that make them “relevant”, involve human behavior and response. At each finite decimal expansion, the rule states: You ought to continue! I always wish to obey.

68. Those who buy this hierarchy of infinities business seem religious, or at least they ought to be treated as if they were. And this means we either must be condescending to mathematicians or philosophically patient with the religious!

69. Can a computer not think but nevertheless act? On what grounds would we say that an artificially intelligent system acted thoughtlessly? I imagine our response would be: “That machine needs an update!” “Thoughtlessly” for a machine means “of an inadequate model or make – something lacking internally.” But for human organisms? Do we say “Bob thoughtlessly did such-and-such” and mean that Bob internally lacked a property? (( Context versus the internal. ))

70. “The condition for a human organism’s being this or that way is different from the condition (or criteria) for an artificially intelligence system.” But is this entirely so? I once held to the idea: A machine makes a mistake. But what does it mean to “make a mistake” generally? And now under the known premise (evidence) that it is a machine. Suppose this occurs 300 years from now, when machines will be further integrated and enmeshed in our ordinary living. Or perhaps 400 years, 500, and so on. This resembles Sorite’s paradox reasoning for the meaning of the term “consciousness.” But have I shown it to be an empty concept? Or have I suggested that it flows with the times — the here and the now? A definition relative to its context; but should we call it a definition? A definition sounds, often, final; to call a thing a “tentative and putative definition” consciously so seems counterintuitive. We get no legwork out of such talk! But back to my point: A machine makes a mistake. I asserted: The condition or circumstance under which we ascribe error to the machine (and not its author) is the condition for similarity in consciousness. Indeed, this assertion depends on the acceptance of “consciousness as a family resemblance concept.” How circular is it for a conscious being to pause and define consciousness? Is this a case of language going on holidy? A case where a word is not doing its proper work under an intended context. The speaker mentions it, but does not use it. Imagine the philosopher as standing between quotation marks through her entire lecture. Imagine a universe between quotation marks. Now reflect on how, or the conditions under which you might connect that which betwene the marks and its context. We have scare quotes, styles of Houses, of consortiums, the use-mention distinction, irony, titles, emphasis, etc. Though incorrect, why is the quotation mark used as such incorrect? And does your answer have any bearing on what I have outlined? Might it nevertheless be used in such a way, to convey the meaning of that which should be used (in some contexts)? Of course, now the question becomes: “I cannot see a paradigm case! So your argument falls flat!”

71. Transcendentalist metaphysics as a misconception of ontological commitment. This seems similar to the “mistake” of treating an irrational number (though properly a rule) as a substantive under the same conception as blocks, cars and houses. The skeptic asks: “But is obeying a rule after one initially resisted really a case of the rule being obeyed?” And then we acknowledge the commitment to objectivity: “Yes, but we must agree on what it means to “resist” and that this is a case of obeying a rule at all (for you to be skeptical about).” The skeptic becomes anxious, of course, and attempts to play our game, if she is bold enough. “But does agreement consist in our entertaining the same words? What confirms that we are even speaking with the same meanings? Is intending with the opposed or conflicting facial expression really a case of intending?” — And thus we notice the limit of the skeptical: it is the limit of my ability, anyone’s ability, to construct him. (( The limit of the skeptic is the limit of our imagination. ))

72. There is no reason to assume the “transcendental” on ground of our inability to continue the skeptical trick. Moreover, although, we should not be fooled that, instead, the “transcendental” is the “principle of skepticism.” We should not be fooled by the conviction the “skeptic” exists in our hearts. As if God planted a “philosopher” in each of us. We must deny that Socrates indeed discovered knowledge in the boy in the Meno. The discovery is properly his method. His method discovered what it presupposed; I draw from this that not even Socrates existed. For to say that he did exist, in exactly the heartfelt and religious way a “philosopher” wishes to, is to claim that he does exist (as a principle). We do call it the Socratic Method. (( A confusion of kinds of substantives. ))

73. Historico-anthropological claim: “I cannot go on!” becomes the ground for our common vocabulary of substantives under a particular kind (the irrationals, “father” of the divine chain, etc).

74. A holism all the way through. God cannot exist outside of a linguistic practice. Is God’s existence “true but not provable” or “true but not proved”? But this is a mistake: “We are concerned with consistency and decidability. If consistent, then undecidability will occur. If decidable, we will mar our consistency. And we might not realize it! This is the problem! We might find ourselves “deciding” on those mysterious propositions that cropped up in our system! Why? Well, we assumed our consistent: We had no reason to go back and check!” Thus, we need a constraint on what it means to realize a thing, realization within a system. We see a connection between: truth, proof, consistency and decidability.

Soundness is a property of logical inference and logical systems wherein inference takes place. If P ? A is provable (or derivable), then P ? A. “P ? A” is an exemplification of a semantic entailment. From truth must come another truth. “P ? A” a syntactic entailment; this form is concerned with preserving truth (of semantic entailment).

75. Russell’s paradox. Sets consist of members. A set can be a member of another set; and sets can fail to be a member of another set. A set can be described numerically, or demonstratively (simply point to all the members). We say, O={1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Conversely, we say “the odd numbers between 0 and 10.” This is an intensional method. We specify a property and check from that property every member in the domain who could or does have that property. The former is explicit, discrete, clear. The latter is subject to meaning. If I demonstrate to you this, that, and the other, nothing is amiss or lost. However, nothing is really conveyed other than that which is pointed to. The extensional method is a demonstration by list. The latter is a description which yields a list.

We say: A cat is a member, or could be a member, of a set. A cat, however, is not a set. A cat is a mammal; but it could be seen as a set. We could sat, idiomatically: look at that set of fur. But we would mean the cat. The set of the first 10 integers means a thing which consists of some members (that thing is a set). A set of 10 pies is not itself a pie; it is a set. We can point out 10 pies or we can say “the pies on the table.” We observe the properties of being on the table and being a pie. We can say the months in a year or list every month. The set of the months is not itself a month. A list which contains one listing per month is not itself one of the listings on its own list.

RP claims: there exists a set which contains all sets who are not members of themselves. So, we have our set of pies, cats and months, none of which is a member of itself. RP claims, minimally, there is a set which consists of sets. What does it mean to be a set? Is a set a construct of a theory? A posit? In what way does it exist? Do sets exist objectively or subjectively? Are we committed to sets when we speak in ordinary language? Is a set a bias of the analytical mode? Do we fail to achieve analysis if we presuppose that a set is not intelligible or real or extant? Does a set ground our analytical procedure or do we suppose it as ground? Is it impossible to analyze linguistic phenomena without this theory? What, moreover, does it mean to analyze a thing?

RP supposes this set to exist (in some way or other). Is it a member of itself? By its own (intensional) description, it might. It is a set at least, but is it a member in the set of all sets who are not members of themselves? We might look to see or we can suppose (a theoretical or intellectual effort). What would looking afford us? Well, would we be looking with our “mind’s eye”? So we suppose that it is a member of itself. If it is a member of itself, then the set of all sets who are not members of themselves (a) contains a set which is a member of itself and (b) who is itself. If it is not a member of itself, then the set of all sets who are not members of themselves does not contain itself; that is, is not a member of itself. But by its own description (our supposition of its existence), it is supposed to be a member of itself.

I intimated this earlier: A backdrop from which you judge the correspondance between the intensional definition and the possibility of correspondance. To be a possibility requires a broad enough background. If I say: The pies on the table. Well, I must look at the entire table (the bare multiplicity w/r/t by description); then I am able to compare my (intensional) description with the possibility set. Then I pick out from my description. But what grounds the possibility set? That is, what shapes its contours? A possibility set comes about from an application. The table becomes my possibility set by presupposition of my intensional description. It was simply a table before my speech act? But do speech acts invoke possibility sets? Well, I could write it down on a paper. But what of the demonstrative method? “But I must know what to demonstrate!”All this is to say: members cannot merely be checked for properties. Members are ultimately members of some set or other. The cats in the tree is one set, some other set is the one behind our explicit one. The possibility set is tacit, discernibly undisclosed. But are we committed to it on pain of …? But do not think: “possibility set” is a contradiction in terms. Clearly we invoke some contours by our intellectualizing. But how is this shaping and grounding possible?

76. The TM, Gödel’s proof, arithmetic (number theory), and the predicate calculus: related by conduit metaphor. Each is a vessel for a conceptual metaphor. The “problems” are contained commonly in each (Cantor’s trick by interpretation). There is the syntactical maneuver (the diagonal) and the semantic sleight of hand (the “consequences” which must be drawn; we must see things this way). (Normativity in mathematics means: “Reduce the impact of intra-metaphorical language within our system and inter-metaphorical transport or reduction between near-formal systems.”; All “near-formal system” means is “idealized language game.” — Arithmetic, TMs, etc, as the old hat says, are idealized language games.)

77. Lakoff & Johnsen: Metaphors (and metonymies) indicate the the kind of (or cultural) spectacles by which we perceive, apprehend, and conceive the world. The metaphor is the dressing cast ’round our brand of thought and experience. Every metaphor is a shibboleth. (Do we choose the metaphor we employ? And what if we show the whole region of language to be metaphorical in grounding? What sense does it make to speak of choosing a metaphor? — for a poet? for a philosopher? for a scientist? for the ordinary many?)

78. Is it a moral (or religious) requirement (duty) to accept a metonymic or metaphoric use of language? If we are resistant to it, in recognizing what it is, are we tacitly expected or bound (in some specific and abstract sense) to approbate it as our own? (Socially speaking? Is it a social constraint?) What pains do we incur in rejecting a language game implicitly or explicitly?

79. Suppose we inductively form a binary correspondence between thought and expression of thought. In us is produced the intuition that they become identical. “Functionally” it is tenable. The results determine the meaning of what it is to function. It is an article of faith that only little detachment, noise and interference arises between result and function. Of course, we say “Yes, indeed, they are not identical, but we are warranted in treating them as such” (where “as such” and “as if” collapse into one another as locutions — perhaps an analogue: suppose the “is” of attribution and the “is” of identity were conflated to the point of being indistinguishable; “And you mean what by ‘is’ here?” — “Well, I’m not quite sure.”).

80. Is a knot a physical or logical impossibility to untangle? Less hyperbolically: Is a knot a physical or a logical problem? Suppose that a knot were undecidable? What would this mean? How could we fail to establish a rule by which we conclude that it is no longer a knot? What will we say is a knot and what is not? The “knot” that resembles the infinity symbol  (or two-thirds of a Gordian Knot), the ones that occur in entangled Christmas lights and chords (for no apparent reason). But is it really a knot? No technique or skill is required to untangle it, you simply expand it and pull one end through, supposing it to have a point of termination. (Naturally, the realist in us asks: suppose it to have no points of termination? How did it come to exist? Could it exist? Is it a chimera that you speak of?) But first: do we call this a knot in the first place? (Our answer: What we call it determines the method by which it is untangled.) The point of contention: Can a knot be unwound a priori? — “Well, of course, it is possible!” And we mean what by “possibility” here? That human nature can overcome any problematic? Your basis for this is: Your intuition? Your humanity? Do you make a statement of fact or an imperative: How I ought to view human nature.

81. The position (or circumstance) in which you ask a question will determine the meaning of that question. (How could an objective meaning even get in? Infiltrate? Gain entrance? — these metaphors presuppose the same logical space; but if I said “permeate” (a virus never infects the whole organism, a spy never, literally, the entirety of the government; but the physical body and the physical buildings, perhaps)? or “orient”? These are descriptions which presuppose as basis the objective meaning: We do not apprehend or fumble within our foundations (for we fumble as we speak sometimes); we step into (sense) or out of (nonsense) them; and this is my old hat: the foundation is language). The meanings themselves are shifting fields on which the firing occurs at the time of the utterance. A firing is a meaning.

82. We see the “world picture” and the picture before us at odds when we think of imperatives. We employ the locutions “the kind of world I would like to live in…” and “I imagine a world wherein everyone…” (ethical possible world semantics for the ordinary) in our moral reasoning. Implicit is the imperative of universalizability, but we speak descriptively insofar as we give a picture of the world we desire. This is where emotivism holds: A possible world is nothing more than a reflection (or expression) of one’s desire. Why? Well, this speech act could do nothing more than this: I have no access to some world as you imagine it. No verbal agreement will establish that I could, for I must agree with you on what “world” means, and this points us back at the beginning of our question.

Suppose I tell you, implicitly or explicitly: You simply must find good some painting present before us. To do this explicitly seems odd: A taboo, opposed to standing social conventions. So odd is it that it may seem unimaginable that it actually occurs. But what of situations of authority, where relata are teacher and child, mentor and apprentice, professor and student, etc. Well, the professor-student relationship is explicit, I say, or at least not obviously implicit. The professor of art history stands before hundreds of students and presumes the import and significance of this or that work. (Some of you will have the urge to ask: “Okay, which works? Give me examples” — And this only proves my point; and if you are “a mathematician” or “a computer scientist” or “an engineer”…?) And the point is this question: Is a presumption an explicit gesture maneuver?

When one tells me of the world she would like to live in, where every individual is like-minded, am I being coerced? What if I do not emphatically and passionately reject this world? Why might I not? The presumption becomes explicit to whom? The philosopher? The moral critic? The anarchist or “postmodern” toward pictures? The vulgar anti-foundationalist? The “constructivist”? Does the concept of this presumption involve, or perhaps require, an imperative?

What good is an imagined counterfactual situation if it is not to be advanced to some other? So we constrain our “possible world semantics” to “local possible worlds.” And by “world” we mean some arbitrary delineation of our culture (Lakoff & Johnson). (Possible worlds as containers of events and situations / the visual field as literal container of what is viewed; it is metaphorical because it is literal (the letters do not actually contain what is perceived. But the possible world is a metaphor. What is before me has trees, verdant green, blazing sun and clear sky; the visual field does not contain it. These things, features before us, are not contained by anything. But the metaphor makes possible the containment. Similarly, events and situations are not contained by anything. Possible worlds make possible the containment. If I tell you that I do not see the deer behind the patch of forest before us, a click beyond the nearest rock; and what if I tell you: “I cannot see that consequence from the ‘might have been otherwise’ you suppose”? Well, I have not misunderstood the make-up of possible world semantics; I have seen aright: We perceive rocks, perceive events all the same. But I do not perceive your perceptions or my own. But what is a possible world? How might I perceive it? Is it a thing before us? (The objectivity required for the possibility of metaphor.)

83. If you want a definitive answer to a moral judgment, that’s a different affair than as to all what your judgment is doing, or what you are doing in virtue of making such a judgment, when you employ it. The latter is much more puzzling and important to the study of ethics.

84. A society, its morality, and its law are each structured wholes. Each must be one way or the other. The limit of law is expressed in that morality would not give it recourse under certain circumstances or conditions. Where morality does not tread, law certainly must remain at bay. But the question becomes: Is morality always the first to take the questionable step? The naturalist answers affirmatively; the positivist answers that law should open the boundaries of moral permissibility. The positivist thinker, moreover, believes that morality is the watched, law the watcher. Morality, that is, cannot be arbiter to itself; it can only feebly go, whereas law goes by order, rationality, and careful scrutiny.

Is morality a feeling? What could we mean by “social feeling”? Well, by social we mean something more general; indeed, morality and law are merely aspects, derivatives, of the social. We were certainly social before lawful, before moral. But do social conventions dictate the direction of our morality? Of our law? Here the social is more primal (primitive) and raw, untamed. The logic that grounds morality is often overlooked: but of the social? Is decorum, etiquette, the platitude logically prior to common morality? You cannot demand that someone be polite from a moral point of view. Social norm by morality is everywhere “permissible”; legal norms (questions, propositions): impermissible or obligatory. Think of a legal question that is deemed unexceptional by morality.

85. The distinction between linear (historical) and logical cause. Modus Ponens is not a spatial principle. Validity by it does not rest on the place of those symbols who represent. Validity hinges upon the logical space (logical cause) and the reasoning in that space as the ground. We deal with a different picture when we deal with logical space. But is this picture connected with the world of sensibility? This question orients the departure of correspondence-truth and realism. But as we have taken for granted: “logical space” is a picture-building term. Moreover, a metaphor. No one need belabor the point: “space” isn’t the absence of all things, unoccupied locality in this context. What does it mean to say “the logical constructions occupy (or do not occupy) this region in logical space”? Obviously we’ve taken the metaphor too far here. But why do people fumble when learning Modus Ponens because certain linguistic representations (“If cats…”; “cats…”; etc) of it fail to be “intuitive”? Or fail to “make sense” to our cultural intuitions? (We confuse the historical problem with the logical; that is, we miss what is being said about logical space, and we become concerned with uninteresting “historical,” fact-finding questions.)

86. The “Buffalo”-sentence: Buffaloadj buffalon Buffaloadj buffalon buffalov, buffalov Buffaloadj buffalon.
The Chomsky-sentence: Colorlessadj greenadj ideasn sleepv furiouslyadv

The former has sense, or it can record a fact. The latter cannot. Both are grammatical. But the popular suspicious turns on whether the former is “meaningful” outside of discourse in linguistic study. The suggestion is that the sentence, if spoken in casual conversation, would be so idiosyncratic that it must either be taken as an invitation to a study of language or simply a jest. Chomsky, moreover, admits the latter to having never been uttered until the time of his writing SS. The same may be said of the former. But what is this divergence of “meaning”? Well, we philosophers are talking about propositional meaning, sense at all or senselessness. Surely “conversational meaning” is broader, and is not reducible to, “sense” in our cumbersome idiom. “conversational meaning” captures culture, familiarity with terms, presence with terms, history with language, wherein “making sense” becomes a culturally constrained activity.

In religious discourse of the everyday, what “makes sense” is likely what is not atheistic w/r/t some doctrine. But it is strange that the actual intelligibility of expression and the competence of the speaker in his linguistic practice is brought into question. But now we have a logical question, not a question on linear cause. The departure turns on the possibility of grammar outside of a cultural practice — “making sense” outside of a language game.

87. Philosophy is the capacity to misspell words.

88. “A society, in part, is defined by those questions of which it refuses to take a position” (Gaita). We may observe a society from two stations: the Anthropological (external) and the Political (internal). These perspectives are such that  we orient ourselves and our investigation of cultural concepts. At bottom we are concerned with the thriving and existence of certain concepts within a culture, whether a concept can be said to be active or passive, explicit or tacit, normative or ignored, etc. (whether a concept can be said to exist within a culture and what exactly this amounts to).

The Anthropologist, or the external view, is concerned with the measure and concrete limits of a concept, the grounds for its application by those to whom the concept is vibrant, active, employed, cognizant, etc. The external view is concerned with the pattern and strict behavior of a concept or set of. Certain conditions are met which ground the successful or unsuccessful application of a concept. Conditions may either be necessary or sufficient, or both. One has successfully applied or used a concept when the sufficient conditions for its application are met. Without question it is unclear that a concept ever is employed sufficiently, or with maximal success. For the most part, pragmatic constraints on conversation determine the meaning of “successful application of a concept.” However, at minimum, it seems to me, the lack of any necessary condition whatever, as explicit or implicit, determines the failure of application. (That is, one is not speaking within the language game of that culture. One may, we might say, be introducing a novel necessary condition or at least proposition a new condition as a candidate to complete or partial sufficiency.) If I say of a cat that it is on a unicorn, it is required of me to be speaking of a thing which meets the condition or set of conditions of cat-hood. At the same time, the preposition’s grounding, the article’s, etc must each lend to the (complete) sufficient condition of the proposition “The cat is on a unicorn.” This proposition has a sense which is grounded by the necessary conditions of its constituents which themselves lend to the first-order necessary conditions of the proposition itself. The constituents’ condition sit at the second-order, or of a lower order generally. We may say that a statement does not record if one of its lower order necessary conditions is not met. So, if “on” does not accord with the actual state of affairs, we may say that the speaker has failed to properly apply the concept “on” and has at the same time failed to acknowledge the actual ground of the appropriate preposition, say “under.”

Questions of this sort may be entertained from the external view. The Anthropologist is concerned with whether speakers successfully or unsuccessfully apply concepts at local contexts, intervals, where, when, why (descriptively).

From the internal perspective or viewpoint, we will be concerned with the correct or incorrect application of  a concept. “Beauty,” by Kant’s standard, was seen as Political in the way I shall describe. The concept of beauty, under Kantian presentation, was seen as, when invoked by a speaker, a candidate of some form. The speaker intends for hearers to agree or to at least consider whether the item, object or artifact in question is by agreement beautiful. We should not say “objectively beautiful.” The speaker is raising the object in question as a candidate for a policy. If two persons consider a thing beautiful, then this bolsters their political weight (as I see it), not the ontological status of the object itself. The objective or subjective nature of the item, this status, is a question of another order. I cannot immediately see what the metaphysical pedigree of an item has to do with two persons in discussion and whether or not they agree on explicit or potentially explicit properties. This is one feature of the internal view with which I am interested: candidacy of an object wherein it might receive a new property. Does “beauty” emerge from an object? Is “beauty” a relation between agreement and the object? That is: Let’s disregard the question of “beauty as related to a subjective state.” Let us regard beauty as a concept which bears a relation to agreements or events of agreement.

More generally, what is the ontological status of agreement? (Ignore questions as to the ontological status of “beautiful objects.”)

89. “We can obey the laws together.” What would make this a true statement? Is there empirical evidence which might lend support to the proposition represented by the statement? All statements which can be questioned as to having any possible physical evidence are automatically insens. And this presupposes that such a question could even be asked.

90. A new beginning — we revisit old thoughts, establish conceptual connections wherebefore obscurity ran deep on account of the practicality of things.

91. Stories exist, and by degrees of imperative. Certain tales, as it were, I find either must be accepted or rejected, where the grounds for one’s status as accepting or reject simply do not enter the situation. Isolated situations, talk exchanges, interpersonal activity, etc would be the foreground whereof such grounds would count as relevant, given the right circumstances. Naturally, some may say “This is not a topic which is open for discussion,” as the context or the site of the talk exchange is viewed as inappropriate from a kind of discussion essential to understanding. Now the fact that this occurs is manifestly true, plain to any observer, but the question, indeed, is why such grounds tend to, under a general observation, fail to count as appropriate more so than they would be viewed as appropriate within a culture. An example may be the discussability of torture. Wherebefore a tragic attack on a culture’s people and esteemed artifacts, the topic’s discussability remain implicit, after the fact, the topic’s discussability may take on an “open” status. The important question, plainly, is: What occurred? What happened to adjust the moral categories to the given culture so as to permit the topic’s discussability? “Moral outrage” would be an answer that presupposes a notion such as: “Certain crimes must be met with certain punishments. And in order to apply those punishments, we must address which kinds of punishment count as retribution.” Conceptually, torture may be viewed as a kind of retributive punishment. Of course, the assumption here is that in applying torture one is punishing the Other. Well, this is a contentious assumption, perhaps: Surely when one requires information to prevent a devastating future attack, torture is viewed on practical grounds. However, merely because one internalizes torture in this way, such an opinion does not necessarily block the perceived view of the act which follows from the maxim: punishment, in a large sense, is perceived, and defined in terms of public criteria which is embodied by the culture’s conceptual scheme.

92. Again, stories exist. At the abstract anthropological level of theorizing, we view cultures in terms of their metanarratives. A metanarrative, then, would be a story, a story which functions, so to speak, as a unifying point for a particular culture from which beliefs and imperatives emerge. Certain artifacts and archetypes compose the structure of any metanarrative, where the particular agents who instantiate those archetypes or the particular corporeal constructs which embody those artifacts. These entities make up the tangible, ontological basis of the metanarrative. Moreover, events, and not time, define the temporal progression of a metanarrative; scientific precision aims at observation under the aspect of no event as such. A trivial claim, to be sure, but in this way we force a demarcation between a subsidiary tale to a metanarrative (a child conceptual scheme) and the metanarrative under which it falls: the extreme scientific worldview (scientism) and Western thought.

“Scientific heroes” and Science have an influence on the general idiom of the Western metanarrative. By influence we mean that the local, or minor tale, engenders ways of speaking deviant and alien to the broader idiom (jargon, etc). Again, this is a trivial claim, but it exposes a conceptual relationship, I believe, between archetypes under cultural localities and denizens of its broader cultural context. We point to hustle and tussle between cultural locations: music subculture and scientific subculture, say. Persistent in these cultures, it is assumed, is a collection of principles, rules or imperatives that fundamentally distinguish them from one another. Denizens of the greater cultural structure, it is my assumption, internalize archetypes and express their features as prototypical persona. I describe their behavior in this way to identify a feature of talk exchanges, wherein ideas are expressed and digested. This idea is connected with Putnam’s claim about appeal to scientific authority in Reference, and I hope my thoughts expose its conceptual structure. Participants, in most cases unknowingly, employ idiomatic ways of talking which presuppose the veracity of scientific findings. Conceptual connections in the wider culture may ride on the production and existence of scientific theories. The point here depends on the description of the Scientific as a subsidiary tale to the metanarrative. Participants in wider culture do not necessarily consider themselves as part of the tale, but yet they are an expression of its influence and they sing its song. …
2011
93. An infant under the sun, mandarin oranges glistening under the humbling rays; the hermit speaks of a day when shadows held their way. The corners furnished pathways into the depths behind the innocuous darkness we grew so comfortably ubiquitous, and yet we penetrated into the many layered horrors of our everyday banality. The shadow held within the total withdrawal of presence, named those absent possibilities which circumscribe actuality. Though impossible, in virtue of a name, principally constructible, the actual derives no meaning from itself, and thus from such as they are, must be constituted by their constructibility, their capacity for being named, structured.

94. Of all the things to have stuck on one’s mind: s. I find it odd, just as an anthropological note, that the  got abused before the concept of the table in Web development. Why do I say this is odd? Is it so clear that the  had specification before the concept of the table? One would think, as a designer, “Tables are quite bland. Why would we ever employ them to represent us?” The table appears Platonic to the designer, one who is ruggedly disinterested in the academic limitations of her craft. So one must wonder — maybe not.

95. Meta-commercials: writers author/represent their “giving up” creatively through the strictures of the television program format. The unabashed underscore of failure is in itself entertaining, building on the viewer’s inherent capacity to relate himself to the humanity in the letter. Again: why do conservationist foundations invest in commercials which blithely ignore the sympathetic trend Westerners have toward “eco-rescue”? A better approach would be to specify in woeful detail, perhaps with a scientific or matter of fact tone, the consequence of a certain extinction of certain species. Moreover, this is a prompt to imagine the mechanisms of evolution, or at least build metaphor into them — for the greater public to internalize. In truth, it seems to me, by observing, highlighting, socializing and commercializing the more excitable, flamboyant and yet nevertheless ultimately contingent and arbitrary features of certain specifies one misses the opportunity to introduce a more estimable reason for that species existence; think: This species sustains our ecosystem. By relating the species to us, we help actualize the humanity in it. If we are doom’d to metaphor, as the neurophilosophers would have it, then why not acknowledge our taxonomy of values and exploit them for the matured protection of our neighboring species: no one cares on the matter of a certain species speed, dexterity, capacity to mimic human forms of communication. It is all ultimately pragmatic; acknowledge, so too, then, the human weakness: pragmatic egotism.

96. In one’s duties, one may be task’d with operating under roles typically held by one person. Odd is it where this is fail’d to be sustain in one’s conscious awareness, given that a role is satisfied within the complex interactions of a social system. The role exists primitively in expression yet manifests through human activity and error. The identification of a role is in itself problematic, seeing as that roles must first be stipulated. Failing to observe and respect the shape of one’s participation within a social ecosystem must itself be constitutive of the role through which one contributes.

97. At one moment an artifact of language may sway those about us, at another — that same artifact — may turn them inert and lame. This is a feature of language, a feature not explicable in terms of truth. Such a concept provides no wedge or tool to distinguish the meaningful from the gaseous. What says that truth resonates save for the vehicle which drives it, sometimes precisely, others feebly? What links those honorific propositions so disconcerting to human concerns and the intelligentsia save for the gardens of linguistic activity?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A collection of my favorite statements, howls, and threats by thinkers, writers, philosophers, poets, heretics, etc.
Words are loneliness.
— H. Miller
Wovon man nicht sprechen kann darüber muß man schweigen.
— L.W.
More generally, a ‘thing’ will be defined as a certain series of aspects, namely those which would commonly be said to be of the thing. To say that a certain aspect is an aspect of a certain thing will merely mean that it is one of those which, taken serially, are the thing.
 — Russell, Our Knowledge of the External World, 1914a, 106–107
The unfitness of the object may cause one to overlook the unfitness of the means.
— Kafke
Everyone carries a room about inside them. This fact can be proved by means of the sense of hearing. If someone walks fast and one pricks up one’s ears, say at night, when everything round about is quiet, one hears, for instance, the rattling of a mirror not quite firmly fastened to the wall.
— Kafke
In a certain sense, infinite divisibility means that space is indivisible, that it is not affected by any division. That it is above such things: it doesn’t consist of parts. Much as if it were saying to reality: you may do what you like in me (you can be divided as often as you like in me.) Space gives to reality an infinite opportunity for division.
— LW
Perchance you who pronounce my sentence are in greater fear than I who receive it.
— Giordano Bruno
I cleave the heavens, and soar to the infinite. What others see from afar, I leave far behind me.
— Giordano Bruno
And the true philosophers are always occupied in the practice of dying, wherefore also to them least of all men is death terrible.
— Socrates, Phaedo
Prove all things. Hold fast to that which is good.
— First Thessalonians 5:21
Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it tries to raise doubts where no questions can be asked. For doubt only can exist where a question exists, a question only where an answer exists, and an answer only where something can be said.
— TLP, Wittgenstein
Obviously, no one would freely choose to become a philosopher – they are, unfortunately, born that way.
— Steven Colbert (?)
5.1362 The freedom of the will consists in the impossibility of knowing actions that still lie in the future. We could know them only if causality were an inner necessity like that of logical inference. The connexion between knowledge and what is known is that of logical necessity. (‘A knows that p is the case’, has no sense if p is a tautology.)
— Wittgenstein, Tractatus
A mathematician is bound to be horrified by my mathematical comments, since he has always been trained to avoid indulging in thoughts and doubts of the kind I develop. He has learned to regard them as something contemptible and… he has acquired a revulsion from them as infantile. That is to say, I trot out all the problems that a child learning arithmetic, etc., finds difficult, the problems that education represses without solving. I say to those repressed doubts: you are quite correct, go on asking, demand clarification!
— Wittgenstein, PG 381
4.003 Most propositions and questions, that have been written about on philosophical matters are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language. ( They are of the kind of question whether the Good is more or less identical to the Beautiful. ) And it is not surprising that the deepest problems are in fact not problems at all.
— Wittgenstein, TLP
In philosophy matters are not simple enough for us to say ‘Let’s get a rough idea,’ for we do not know the country except by knowing the connections between the roads. So I suggest repetition as a means of surveying the connections.
— Wittgenstein
Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upwards.
— Book of Job
Distrust of grammar is the first requisite of philosophizing.
— Wittgenstein, Notebooks
I don’t know why we are here, but I’m pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.
— Wittgenstein
If you can’t say it clearly, you don’t understand it yourself.

We all inherit a great deal of useless knowledge, and a great deal of misinformation and error (maps that were formerly thought to be accurate), so that there is always a portion of what we have been told that must be discarded. But the cultural heritage of our civilization that is transmitted to us — our socially pooled knowledge, both scientific and humane — has been valued principally because we have believed that it gives us accurate maps of experience. The analogy of verbal words to maps is an important one [...]. It should be noticed at this point, however, that there are two ways of getting false maps of the world into our heads: first, by having them given to us; second, by creating them ourselves when we misread the true maps given to us.
— S. Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action
A person of true refinement would have expressed much of that very differently, but nothing will ever make up for the lack of a classical education.

It has always been the prerogative of children and half-wits to point out that the emperor has no clothes. But the half-wit remains a half-wit, and the emperor remains an emperor.

In chess, the object of the game is clear, the rules are fixed and indisputable, and there is always a definite outcome (win, lose, or draw) about which no controversy can arise.  In philosophy, the object and the rules are themselves part of what is in play, and there is never an incontrovertible result.

So I need both of these gifts of the gods.  Chess to recuperate from the uncertainty of philosophy, and philosophy to recuperate from the sterility of chess.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Academic & personal background
Student of Philosophy with a degree (B.A) in that field from University of Houston. With focus and primary interest in philosophy of language, epistemology, metaethics, metaphysics, logic, Wittgenstein, and Spinoza.
Metaphilosophical view
The philosopher’s task is to clean up language (help others discover the logic of our language). That is, philosophy is the logical clarification of linguistic systems. Philosophy’s purpose is exhausted by this agenda. The philosopher has no business, and cannot have business in, as a philosopher, in the transactions of norm, evaluation and morality.
Religious positions
Do I believe in God? Can’t answer, I’m afraid. I’m not being flippant, but I don’t understand the question.
— Noam Chomsky
I find this response must be ground floor on which all religious dialogue unfolds. We must eschew the presupposition that the question itself is obvious. That is, that an answer follows obviously this way or that; or, that one flouts an solidified social rule in questioning the legitimacy of the question itself. Is the question about epistemology, or is it a question about what one is capable of doing? Is the question a ticket on which a certain answer grants access, having taken or earned that ticket, through a social door? Is the question social or is it political? Does one expect a genuine answer or does one merely expected a conformance? Does every question expect an answer or merely a response?

Generally, I do not identify with atheism as it falls under those political and social orientations. I am no underdog, nor am I a champion of any ideology. Whether the atheist receives greater and more freedoms, whether a greater quantity of satisfactions, etc is of no concern of mine.

Under the “broad” conception of atheism, as it merely describes us under the anthropologists point of view, I am atheistic with respect to the Judeo-Christian God. But this is innocuous and unilluminating. No one should be shocked that one is in denial, implicitly or explicitly, of the fundamental tenets or propositions of some one doctrine or other. Naturally, what remains to be determined is how those propositions, or sets of, connect with the “reality” they, on most cases, they presume to be and to be in some (one) way or other. I seek not to advance a skeptical claim with that last remark, but I do acknowledge, and do not unhesitatingly or by conventional habit or by pragmatic preoccupation, the position of the skeptic.

Is religion nothing more than (a collection of) language games? Is it a family resemblance concept under which our sole purpose as philosophers is to outline its similarities, contours, boundaries, key linguistic expressions, rules, and so on? Is every religious doctrine nothing more than another color on the canvas of the amorphous concept?

The second most important question which must orient a dialogue on religion is: Well, just what is evidence? What are we doing when we call this evidence and that not, when it is and when it is not? And what are the conditions under which one may reasonably call something evidence? Moreover, what is the relation between interpretation and the evidence which is interpreted? What does it mean to have non-interpreted evidence, and is the religious (or perhaps superstitious) person committed to this sort of thing? (A question of the obvious existence of realism and its object; that which would be the case and what we would call it “ontologically bare evidence.”)
Metaphysics
One should permit existence to a thing within one’s ontology not without caution and attention to the grammar on which it knocks at one’s door.

We must attend to the hygiene of our conceptual schemes.
Science
Science is research; it is the systematic generation of output of a certain kind, that kind being tangible, actionable, measurable discovery. Its basic unit, if it can be said to have one, is the sensible, material world.

Science cannot justify an identity claim. An identity claim is a claim about which the sense of the terms guarantees its truth. Science can never be the investigation into sense, before which our language stands. And it stands unstably, confusedly, and mysteriously (some may say). Must science see a thing as miraculous before it becomes a proper object of study?

Science cannot justify the claim that the mind and the brain are one. Nor can it draw any conclusion or consequence or entailment, which necessarily presuppose this claim, as if it had been justified. If this is done, fiction is the only output. No amount of scientific jargon and charlatanry will justify or make coherent a scientific fiction. Moreover, scientists ought not speak as though they have “defeated” philosophy. Theirs is an output on sense, or it should be, and never scientific proposition, the prediction, the probability. Something which is probably sensical or near to what makes sense is no less nonsense than obvious nonsense.

That is, just what is the language of science? The entities, definitions, its grammar? Let us not be concerned with the realist question, or the question of how realism gets off the ground. Let us not speak about correspondence: let us discover and investigate the activity of speaking, expressing, scientifically — the doings of scientists.
Mathematics
Mathematics is comprehensively comprised by the activity of mathematicians. We do not describe, nor could we, the reality of mathematics (the mathematical reality). Since there is no mathematical reality at all. The mathematical proposition exists not in the way the proposition exists. So why call it “proposition”? (The proposition: there is a correspondence between myself and the world, I reveal a fact. That is, there are no mathematical facts.)

We may, with less or better accuracy, the behavior of mathematicians. The “world” of mathematics, say, of numbers, is not “more objective.” The metaphor is simply unfortunate.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">Jon Marshall</span></h1>
University of Technology, Sydney
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Internet, and information technology generally, is not separate
from the social world in which it is embedded, neither does it fully
determine that world. It may, however, allow modifications, intensifications
or even subversions to occur. This paper will discuss some of the
problems and paradoxes of the "Information economy" and
its regimes of property; issues around the so-called hacker ethic
and open source software; and some of the expectations which have
been held for the Internet's role in fostering democratic politics.
It is possible the idea of the "information economy" itself
has a negative effect by suggesting a whole new range of property
to be appropriated and kept from common use. The term "information"
is not a concept which links things together because they are similar
in the same way. It is an open and magical term, which may hide
as much as it reveals. Its popularity may even suggest it serves
some kind of existing social agenda. Even if the equally vague term
"knowledge workers" does prove useful in analysis within
this kind of framework, such people are not in a strong position
relative to expanding corporate power, especially given problems
with the volume and inaccuracy of data available to them. The Internet,
though providing pathways for contact between subgroups, may not
provide ideal pathways for discussion or organisation. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#1">[1]</a>
<a name="return1"></a>

It is suggested that property is a contested imaginary, growing
out of systems of power and exchange. Initially the Internet seems
to have run largely as a prestation economy, in which the exchange
of "gifts" in return for recognition was a governing factor.
Richard Barbrook (1999) argues that this implies a virtual democratic
communism in actual practice – something which is unlikely. This
prestation economy seems vulnerable to capitalist definitions of
property operating within the model of an "information economy"
in which the most important aspect of property is that it can be
charged for. This capitalist property is created by fencing off
information through extension of copyright and patent laws, or by
concealment. Parts of the "hacker economy" still exist,
and the struggle between the supporters of open and free software
illustrates the way that information capitalism operates to diminish
free exchange.

Hackers, or more generally "knowledge workers", are often
considered to be a vital part of the new economy. Himanen (2001a),
for example, with the approval of Manuel Castells (2001), suggests
that Hackers are to the new Information Age and freedom what Max
Weber's Protestants were to the Capitalist Age. This argument can
be supported only by ignoring many features of the current period.
Furthermore, in an information society, information may not be valued
according to its accuracy, but according to its role in a pre-existent
set of politicised, or marketing, biases. In which case certainty
will drive out accuracy. Finally, there is nothing inherent in the
use of the Internet for political discourse which guarantees a democratic
or egalitarian result. The emerging structures of the "Information
Age" may be largely anti-democratic, tending to what has been
called 'Information Feudalism' reinforcing inequalities, with control
of both media and content in the hands of a small minority. Control
of information in the information society, is the equivalent of
control of land in feudalism, with no State support for the relatively
powerless (Drahos and Braithwaite, 2002). If so, then the Internet
may be embedded within these tendencies rather than inherently opposed
to them.

Instead of the upcoming triumph of a new economy, it is possible
to see the forcible return of the old. To quote Steven Best and
Douglas Kellner:
<blockquote>Though ballooned out of proportion by the financial industries,
the Internet boom represented a new economy lead by a young vanguard.
The Bush II regime can be seen in many ways as a return to the
old guard, the old extraction-based economy that sees economic
advancement as a win-loss game best advanced through imperialist
expansion. (2003)</blockquote>
Lawrence Lessig also warns that those who benefited under the "old
regimes" are fighting to retain control over the new environment,
and are likely winning (Lessig, 2001). There is no reason to assume
the old order has lost or will lose – even if it may be slightly
transformed.

It might even be possible to suggest that Information Technology
enables the intensification of trends of classical capitalism as
analysed by Marx, such as: globalisation of a particular culture;
destruction of national industries; inflation of the size of particular
cities; increasing inequality; increasing monopolisation; making
labour an appendage to the machine; freeing capital from local regulation;
turning the State into a managing agent for the benefit of corporations;
increasing the spread of directives and the control of land and
people; turning all values into property or monetary exchange, and
so on (Marshall, 2000). This resurgence of capitalism, and the extension
of the corporate model into previously immune aspects of life, will
be taken as the background social trend in what follows.
<h2>Information Economy</h2>
Nick Dyer-Witheford remarks that:
<blockquote>On the eve of the twenty-first century the only revolution spoken
of in advanced capitalism is the information revolution …
Along with a number of synonymous or associated terms – "postindustrialism",
superindustrialism", "the technotronic society",
"the wired society", "the control revolution",
"high technology society", "the second industrial
divide", "post-Fordism", "the globalization
of technology"… [it] has come to define contemporary
hopes and anxieties about the future. (1999: 16)</blockquote>
To theses terms we might add Castells' use of 'Network Society'
and his preference for the term 'informational society' (Castells,
1996: 21). Castells defines the network society as 'a social structure
made of information networks powered by information technologies
characteristic of the informationalist paradigm' (Castells, 2001:
166). He is clearly discussing similar ideas.

The concept of the knowledge or information economy was probably
introduced into general use by Peter Drucker or Alvin Toffler in
the early '60s. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#2">[2]</a> <a name="return2"></a>Most
of the earlier scenarios were optimistic. Toffler's first book,
<em>The Culture Consumers </em>(1964), suggested that we would primarily
live by creating "culture", as we would all have so much
leisure, and he was not alone in this hope of a regime of free creativity.
Something else obviously happened.

The general idea first gained academic respectability in Daniel
Bell's formulation of the 'Post-Industrial Society', dependent upon,
and organised around, technical knowledge and knowledge workers
– the 'major class'. Knowledge workers were said to act as an intermediary
between the owners of capital and the workers, and acted to improve
the standards of living for workers through the application of knowledge
and planning within capitalism (Daniel Bell, 1976: 14-33, 374).
Bell was later to drop the idea of the importance of government
planning in line with the use of the "new information age"
rhetoric to deregulate capitalism.

The idea of the knowledge or information worker is an important
part of most information society formulations. Alvin Gouldner (1979)
developed this idea into the 'New Class', a combination of intellectuals
and technical intelligentsia, which often inhabited bureaucracies
but were not simply bureaucrats and were functionally independent
of capitalism. Views of the role of these knowledge workers varied.
Gouldner, and Drucker tended to see them as potentially powerful
(even as controlling capital) whereas Toffler saw them as fragmented,
with few obvious common interests providing any organising points
(Drucker, 1968: 276; Gouldner, 1979; Toffler, 1984: 38, 84, 114).
Both views seem accurate. A very few managerial workers control
large amounts of capital – although they must do so in the perceived
interests of the shareholders – but most knowledge workers do not
exert much power or cross industry organisation. In reality, only
particular kinds of knowledge and connections count (Angell, 2000:
53ff). Later theorists such as Himanen and McKenzie Wark, tend to
correlate knowledge workers with "hackers" and shall be
discussed later.

According to Dyer-Witheford the first American book with the words
information society in its title was published in 1978, although
the US Government office of Telecommunication had published Mark
Porat's The Information Economy the year before (1999: 20-1). In
the eighties and nineties information society theory largely became
entangled with deregulated capitalism (Drahos and Braithwaite, 2002).
Some of the same theorists who supported deregulation also tended
to predict social breakdown if deregulation was resisted. At best
those who resisted were luddites and would be superseded. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#3">[3]</a>
<a name="return3"></a>It seems that the general theoretical boundaries
of the analysis were established by the late 1980s and we can roughly
summarise them as follows:

Main Points:

1. Knowledge or information is central to the "new economy"
both to its organisation and to the production of wealth. Information
is the society's raw material. Facticity is important.

2. The use of Information Technology is changing society – it
is a shift at least comparable to that from Agrarian Society to
Industrial Society. There is often a technologically determinist
ring to the argument.

3. Knowledge workers, are central to this change – either as
creative innovators or manipulators of symbols. They are forming
an increasing percentage of the work force.

Subsidiary Points:

4. The local, or national, becomes opposed to, or challenged by,
the Global. Ethnic and Religious identities can become more or less
important.

5. Speed becomes of increasing importance, both in terms of production
and distribution. The implication is that the system is responsive,
flexible and able to reconfigure. People's experience of Time/Space
is changing.

6. Capitalism is largely being "improved" (or as suggested
above, intensified) by this change.

7. There are lengthening chains of interdependence, linkages through
virtual networks not dependent upon place, class, time or identity,
that are all facilitated by IT.

8. The transformation is generally positive with increases in democracy
and freedom. Government and corporations are decentralised, and
hierarchy diminishes.

9 .There is a shift from an economy based on exchange of goods to
an economy based in speculation. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#4">[4]</a>
<a name="return4"></a>
<h2>Problems with the term "information"</h2>
There are well known problems with the term "information".
One is that it is used for many different things with very different
applications. It not only has a specialised meaning in mathematics,
but is applied to useful instructions, data about anything, novels,
plans, scientific research, financial projections, design specs
for a product, PR spin, painting, sports trivia and so on. It might
be argued that in contemporary society these things are considered
equivalent – partly because they can all be transmuted into digital
format, but also because of the move to evaluate everything by how
much people or organisations are prepared to pay for them. This
turns information into "product" which is valued by "appeal"
rather than by accuracy.

As Jacques Vallee points out, data does not become information,
or become useful, outside of a purpose, and it is the purpose that
creates value (1982: 46). Socially valued purpose may be determined
by already instituted power ratios and may be bent towards control.
If the overriding value is corporate profit, then information contrary
or apparently irrelevant, to profit will be devalued or perhaps
even suppressed.

Information also marks a problem for classical economics, as perfect
information is postulated in a functioning market. However, information
itself provides direction in the market and thus becomes valuable
and no longer evenly distributed. Prices don't simply reflect supply
and demand but give messages about them. A declining share price
gives the message the market is abandoning a company and the value
of the company is thereby affected (See Drucker, 1993: 183ff.; Soros,
1994). Businessman Mark Porat argues that 'merchants live off imperfect
information' (Burstein and Kline, 1995: 419). Concealment and special
knowledge is part of the game, not openness.

Toffler argued that information was a difficult concept for capitalist
economic theory because information is a potentially unlimited resource
unlike labour, capital or land. A person's stock of information
is not reduced by another possessing it and information is not consumed
and destroyed but can generate more (1984: 21-2). Many others have
said likewise. Wark, for example, argues that 'information need
not be subject to the laws of scarcity at all. My possession of
some information does not deprive you of it' (Christopher, 2002).

This constitutes a zone of friction.

Property, Distribution and Knowledge Workers

As "information" can supposedly be generated without
limit, and without any obvious connection to "things",
it becomes plausible to reintroduce the theory of eighteenth century
British philosopher David Hume that Imagination creates property
and value.

Property is established through Imagination firstly though its
imaginal connection with other values such as pleasure, freedom
or survival (Hume, 1888: 314), and secondly through the action of
social laws (494) which depend upon the functions of the imagination
for whatever appeal they have (505-13) and which 'vanish ... upon
a more accurate inspection into the subject' (527). Government and
law exist to make or to justify the 'distinction of property and
... the different ranks of men' (1888: 402). Hume also argues that
the value of goods is not dependent upon labour, but on the valuation
and imagination of the powerful. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#5">[5]</a>
<a name="return5"></a>Imagination is made real through custom and
ritual. So any investigation of property has to look at modes of
appropriation and reward and the ways that these are ritualised.

The legitimacy of information, in an information society, is guaranteed
by the rituals of its (corporate) source, by their name and sigils,
and their ability to use other names. Wealth, power, ritual and
presence transform signals into Information and value.

Appropriation is affected by the politics of distribution as is
shown in economists Robert Frank and Philip Cook's model of 'The
Winner Take All Economy'. In this economy, due to the ease of replication,
only the skills of a very few people are actually needed. Their
recurrent example is that only the very best opera singers will
have their cds bought in numbers. Publishing companies will remove
their focus from middle selling authors to promote their best selling.
This leads to a situation in which only a few people become really
wealthy or successful. Frank and Cook assert that information technology
is 'increasing leverage for the talents of those who occupy top
positions, and correspondingly less room for others to find a lucrative
niche' (1995: viii). The same is true of "star programmers"
as opposed to "Microserfs" (Lessard and Baldwin, 2000).
The rest of us get progressively devalued.

One criticism of Frank and Cook's model might be that they adhere
too strongly to the idea that the successful is always "the
best" – that is clearly not always the case. What succeeds
is what succeeds, not what might be preferable. That cane toads
wipe out native fauna is not an improvement. CEOs, despite the ideology,
are often rewarded despite failure. As production heads for the
intangible, it becomes more important for a company to give the
right signals to its customers (often the shareholders, not the
purchasers of its "goods"), and the salary paid to the
CEO becomes a signal of their competence; it reassures shareholders
that everything is being done. Celebration of success becomes a
way of legitimating differential extractions.

As it is often alleged any human can make information then, in
modern information capitalism, it is implied that those without
money are immoral and unenlightened. Money makes human. The poor,
by these lights, are sub-human. The best get more and are defined
as the best by having more. As Kellner writes:
<blockquote>those who celebrate the coming information society tend not to
focus on what kind of society produces an information highway
and multi-media cornucopia for its privileged denizens while denying
others the basic necessities of life. (1994)</blockquote>
With the possibility of increasing inequality of wealth and control
suggested by this factor alone (and the evidence is that inequality
of wealth is increasing) there may also be a greater loss of political
equality. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#6">[6] </a><a name="return6"></a>The
wealthy can fund political parties, pay others to campaign in their
interest, propagate messages more widely and so on. They are more
<em>noticed</em>, and their words are heeded.

Knowledge workers not in this fortunate position have further problems.
There are considerable demands upon the worker's time – they can
be on demand via phone and email at all times and expected to respond
to any "emergency" whatever the demands of their non work
life – they are never truly away from work. The costs of administration
have been shifted on to the worker, who has to fill in all the bureaucratic
demands of the organisation, and this takes time away from dealing
with a workload which has not diminished. The person is expected
continually to retrain himself or herself for work, diminishing
their time for interests in the wider world. These workers are insecure
as work tends towards contracts and perpetual dismissal. Total flexibility
is demanded from them to accommodate to the wishes of the employer
and the system. Communication systems mean that they have to compete
against the whole world to work, in what is often thought as a downward
spiral of wages. This is also some evidence that knowledge work
is being continually deskilled by the movement of industrial methods
into the office, which also means that the competition for work
and the lowering of wages is more pronounced. The often praised
"flattening" of organisations can increase centralised
control by removing the buffering middle layer, which allowed flexibility
of response and provided intermediate jobs: one is either an owner
or a slave.

Mark Poster has suggested that increased surveillance mechanisms
allow workers to survey management equally, but he gives no evidence
for this rather unlikely bi-structuring (Poster, 2002). The Law
in Australia and the US seems to allow employers to read and ban
workers for the content of their emails (Lowe, 2003: 1). ISPs may
be held responsible for the contents of Web sites which a corporation
considers defamatory, thus not encouraging the distribution of criticism.
Existent and external power is not irrelevant in politics. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#7">[7]</a>
<a name="return7"></a>

If information is important, then uncovering hidden information
(not just plans, or replications of a product but also information
about people) becomes even more economically important. Commercially
sponsored hacker raids on other corporations are part of net folklore
(cf Ruskoff ,1994: 31-2). This almost certainly diminishes the freedom
of "knowledge workers", or of the supposed "creators".
Any knowledgeable employee has the potential to cost a corporation
huge amounts of money, either through carelessness, though going
public, or through selling information to a competitor. Therefore,
internal surveillance increases the more internal openness <em>might</em>
occur. Frequently, knowledge workers have written into their contracts
that after leaving their current employment they cannot work in
a similar field. This has the potential to render their knowledge/experience
of less benefit to them and render them more vulnerable to market
fluctuations and the increasingly temporary nature of employment.

None of these features would automatically increase democratisation.
At best they leave the worker harried, rushed and exhausted. This
forces focus on competitive survival, not on creative, or participatory,
politics and free exchange.

The rulers of industrial economies, which may have been threatened
with Revolution, saw that the provision of wages which enabled people
to purchase consumer goods, and the participation of people in the
State, enabled the continuance of their own power and prosperity.
The information economy seems to remove the necessity of practical
common ground between the controllers of capital and the majority
of the population.
<h2>Creation of Property</h2>
As costs of replication decrease, the current dominant corporations
have moved to protect the prices charged and their profit margin,
by creating information scarcity, or by hindering information exchange
or reproduction via patenting or copyright. Lester Thurow writes
that: 'the days of the low-cost sharing of private knowledge are
over' and that:
<blockquote>The Industrial Revolution began with an enclosure movement that
abolished common land in England. The world now needs a socially
managed enclosure movement for intellectual property rights or
it will witness a scramble among the powerful to grab valuable
pieces of intellectual property, just as the powerful grabbed
the common lands of England three centuries ago. (Schiller, 1999:
77)</blockquote>
Microsoft, for example, through its subsidiary Corbis has 'effectively
acquired the rights to the photographic record of history' (Hallacy,
2000). British Telecom recently attempted to claim ownership of
the idea of "web links" and demanded tribute. They lost
in law, but in theory Xerox, as the probable originator, could make
the same demand legally.

The public domain, in all forms, is continually encroached upon:
<blockquote>Patents are increasingly stretched out to cover "ideas"
that twenty years ago all scholars would have agreed were unpatentable:
the so-called business method patents, which cover such "inventions"
as auctions or accounting methods, are an obvious example. Most
troubling of all are the attempts to introduce intellectual property
rights over mere compilations of facts … stretched interpretations
of novelty and nonobviousness allow intellectual property rights
to move closer and closer to the underlying datalayer. (Boyle,
2002: 16)</blockquote>
In the information economy "creativity" has become a
magical term used to carve out property from social and collaborative
(or mixed) processes so as to justify ownership although it is usually
not the creator who owns but their employer, replicating the capitalist
appropriation of labour generally. Corporations may require workers
to generate patents, but those patents do not belong to the inventors.
James Boyle writes:
<blockquote>[I]nformation presents special [social and conceptual] problems
and the discourse of authorship seems to solve its problems ...
The author stands between the public and private realms, giving
new ideas to the society at large and being granted in return
a limited right of private property in the artefact he or she
has created. (Boyle, 1996: xii)</blockquote>
A constructed Corporate Author became legitimated as a point of
origin, almost at the moment that theory pronounced the death of
the author. The claim suppresses both the claims of sources, groupwork,
and audience. It could be suggested that assertions that web pages
are inherently without authors because they are hypertext (Poster,
2002) act in favour of corporate ownership and the diminishment
of writer's rights.

This extension of copyright clashes with the ethos of free exchange
which developed via the Internet when there were large sections
of traffic outside corporate influence. It particularly clashes
with the easy exchange of solutions to technical problems which
allowed the Net's construction (Lessig, 2001; King et al., 1997:
26ff; Schiller, 1999: 10). The Net and the Web may only be able
to work through the ease of making copies at various storage points
and transmission nodes – memory replication is at the heart of computer
functioning. It is conceivable that a stringent application of copyright
could interfere with this transmission. As we shall see, many original
denizens of the Internet objected strongly, although without much
effect, to commercial incursion, and continue to champion "open
source" software as part of this tradition of free exchange.
Such an extension of copyright also clashes with creativity in general
as "information products" are often based on fragments
of other information products (Boyle, 2002: 19). For example, Shakespeare's
plays are based on earlier sources, earlier forms, and often use
earlier phrases. Any information product is embedded in some kind
of history and system of other products and schemas.

As most products are part of a system, companies fight over standards,
partly to keep people who purchase part of a system, locked within
that system, and partly to gain a time lead over their competition,
and to be able to charge royalties to those who decide to use, or
add to, their established system (Toffler, 1990: 130). The volume
of the adoption of a system makes that system more attractive as
more products are made for it. Thus, given that the Windows market
is at least 10 times the Apple Mac market, a company writing Windows
software has only to get 10% of the Windows market to sell as many
items as if they cornered the whole of the Mac market. Under the
requirements of capitalism, people have more profit incentive to
write for Windows and variation is diminished. This trend to monopoly
can also extend to companies, and so the number of organisations
making computers or writing software diminishes (Philipson, 2001).
When standards are not set by market power, they are set by a relatively
few individuals, in committees, trading benefits to their company
or organisation, and building in resistances to certain types of
change.

This uniformity in software intensifies replication issues. People
(particularly in poorer countries) find that the cost of purchasing
the goods they need is prohibitive compared to the cost of replicating
them. As a result the US has threatened trade wars against Asian
countries such as Thailand. While accepting human rights violations
in China, the US threatened to revoke Chinese trade privileges over
copyright (Toffler, 1990: 329-30, 469). It appears corporations
still need States to enforce the laws that make their operations
possible. That States appear not to use this leverage to gain concessions
from corporations is interesting.

In this set up, even natural phenomena get turned into property
– although this is not new. Europeans have turned land into exclusive
property for a long time. Courts say that if genes were not patentable
then there would be no research. They assume appropriation drives
knowledge, and so Courts have granted copyright to the discoverers,
or first users, of naturally occurring genes and viruses. In a case
in Australia in 1996, the company whose researchers discovered the
Hepatitis C virus and which produces tests for that virus went to
court to prevent another company from releasing cheaper and different
tests for the same virus on the grounds that they have copyright
on the virus. Despite the human genome project being publicly funded,
various companies have claimed patents on various strips of the
DNA. One company, Genetic Technologies, claims to own 95% of all
the DNA of every creature on the planet and requires researchers
to pay a license fee to research its property (Smith, 2003: 4).

However, information is only one of many types of property. The
old economy has not disappeared and shapes the "new".
Although George Gilder and Newt Gingrich proclaimed the 'overthrow
of matter' (Dyson et al., 1992), they still wanted the material
substrata of the information age, and the power it supposedly no
longer brings, to belong firmly in corporate, not public, hands.
Indeed, control of wires and air waves seems to be a vital part
of corporate strategy for the future. This could reasonably be supposed
to fit in with increased possibility of corporate control of content
and to affect possibilities of use (Marshall, 2001: 82-6).
<h2>Factuality in an Information Economy</h2>
The problem of 'data smog', or information overload (Shenk, 1977)
affects facticity. Peter Varian and Hal Lyman estimate that in 2002
five exabytes of information were created. This is 'equivalent in
size to the information contained in half a million new libraries
the size of the Library of Congress print collections' (Lyman and
Varian, 2003). Even the amount of email, knowledge workers have
to deal with and filter, in addition to existing work, has been
found to add to stress (AAP, 2003: 5; Wright, 2003: 6). Finding
all relevant data amidst this volume is probably impossible – selecting
the relevant information is extremely hard. Pre-existent bias creeps
in. Even if search engines are not configured to bring up sponsoring
organisations and suppress critical organisations, issues of authority,
of being noticed or selected are not simply overcome. Major organisations
tend to have the authority of their brand, a lone writer has to
do far more work to have their views noticed and relayed beyond
a small group, however accurate their thought.

In a situation of informational profusion, marketing may be more
important than accuracy, in disseminating information. The leading
strategies become dominant over the means of dissemination, convincing
people that certain types of information are preferable, building
a reputation in the market for good information, and provision of
an attractive market for information.

Academic and artistic discourse seems to be marginalised when not
supporting the dominant order, illustrated by, for example, the
apparent effort to remove post-colonialist theory from US universities
as "anti-American" (Subcommittee on Select Education).
The same may be true of science as shown by the exclusion of warnings
of global warming from official reports (Campbell, 2003: 19).

The more that information becomes a commodity, then the less accurate
it may become. There are several complementary reasons for this:

1. Information as commodity is defined by its appeal to a market,
whether that market be readers or disseminators, which means that
accuracy is not its primary characteristic.

2. As the market value of information depends on scarcity, information
providers will have incentive for hiding what they know, or restricting
access, by issuing inaccurate, or covering, information (assuming
people cannot be prevented from using that information otherwise).
This result may be limited by growing distrust of a disseminator,
but it is not clear how great an impedance this will be if all major
information sources act in the same way.

3. Information refers to other information. For example share prices
give messages about the value and functionality of a company as
well as act as measures of that value. Thus there is further imperative
to hide deleterious information or produce spurious information
in order to gain market advantage. One may be the first to know
the "real" relation between a company and its value or
make a company valuable by giving out selective information.

4. Value is largely subjective in the first place. Hence there
is more interest in creating a subjective sense of value, or lack
of value, amongst "those who matter", than there is in
any impartial reckoning – assuming impartiality was possible.

5. As gross inequality increases, so does the pressure towards
violence or distortion of reality. In which case, there is a large
degree of "social utility" in maintaining inaccuracy.
Propagating a more accurate view of reality might be exceedingly
difficult and acting on it might encounter all kinds of resistances.

There is no reason that a society should not collapse under the
weight of its own "self deception" or inaccuracies, if
the forces reinforcing the inaccuracies are more influential than
the forces leading towards embrace of accuracy. The Soviet Union
might be an example.

Dissemination of this kind of falsity can be blamed on increasing
corporate control of the media, decreasing numbers of media owners,
cronyism between corporate controllers and political figures, decreasing
security of employment for reporters, fear of bringing bad news
to superiors. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#8">[8]</a> <a name="return8"></a>Or,
if you are right wing, on a "liberal intelligentsia" occupying
positions of power in the media (e.g. Kohn, 2003; Goldberg, 2003).
<a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#9">[9]</a> <a name="return9"></a>Such
factors may be part of a temporary structure of media personnel,
however it more probably is related to the kinds of pressure, mentioned
above, which lead to trading in inaccuracy and more particularly
in expressions of absolute certainty. People only rarely seem to
read books with politics different to their own – preferring to
stay with their own certainties.

It might be that in an environment of near instantaneous transmission
it becomes near impossible to allow time for the suspensions of
certainty which allow creative explorations of options. Indeed,
whether it was in the interests of those with certainty or not (and
human beings often seem convinced by certainty and repetition),
certainty will tend to drive out creativity because it is easier
to replicate – it tends to be shorter with less prevarication. The
culture of the TV sound bite is well known, as are the complaints
about it from "print journalists". Instead of complexity
we are delivered a summary certainty. If certainty is easier to
replicate, then it will also be easier to find. And thus it might
tend to veil problems with a particular political position, reinforcing
that position and thus allowing developments, and propagation, from
that false certainty.

Right wing commentators in the US frequently argued that the Clinton
Administration was bedevilled with "spin". With the arrival
of Bush Jr. such allegations have not ceased, with assertions that
this US administration relies on lies and deceit from the "theft"
of an election, to the aims of its economic policies, to war on
Iraq (see Kellner, 2002; Corn, 2003; Conason, 2003). It is well
known that the current Prime Minister of Australia is likewise given
to "not being told" of "facts" which contradict
his inclinations.

With the war on Iraq, which seems to have been under consideration
from the days after September 11, the time could have been used
for careful planning of the aftermath, but was instead used in reiterating
certainties about how easy it would be to impose democracy and how
all Iraqis would welcome a US presence. It seems the resistance
took the proposers of the war by surprise. Similarly, if the presence
of "Weapons of Mass Destruction" was known as a lie to
the Bush Administration, then we could have expected that they would
make the lie good, by planting such weapons. Instead it appears
they were surprised by the Weapon's absence. Certainty had driven
out accuracy. In which case, we can propose that certainty and inaccuracy
are not just propaganda, but enmesh the operations of the modern
State and its political system, and that this may have to do with
the mode of information itself.

In an information economy, at a certain level, bad information
which fits in with previous biases, or the needs of PR, drives out
good information which challenges them. This is in keeping with
the argument that an information economy tends to be targeted at
marketing, or controlling and keeping the customer, rather than
"real utility".

This suggests that a democracy based on accuracy of information
as a determination of action would be unlikely. It is more likely
that fragmentation into particular uncommunicative certainties would
result. Something which largely seems to be the case in actual Internet
based discussions of politics.
<h2>Prestation Economy</h2>
If, as is implied by Hume, conceptions of property and ownership
are arbitrary and can vary between societies, then it is useful
to consider other forms of economy such as "prestation",
or gift economies – especially as the traditional behaviours of
Internet users have frequently been compared to such economies (Barbrook,
1998, 1999; Raymond, 1999). In such economies, people give gifts
to others, which are evaluated by others, and which usually carry
some level of obligation to give gifts or recognition in return.
This translates into status but not into exclusive fixed ownership
or accumulation. Status must be constantly recycled or re-earned.
It is fairly unstable. Capitalism usually destroys prestation economies,
as recycling profit back to relatives or others prevents the accumulation
of capital.

It needs to be emphasised, against writers like Barbrook, that
a prestation economy is not necessarily harmonious or self sustaining
– potlatch is hostile exchange which became out of control and destructive
of the societies it emerged within. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#10">[10]</a>
<a name="return10"></a>Prestation economies can also link people
who have never met and never will meet in vast cycles or networks
of exchange which can be disrupted at many points. It is not obvious
why academics should have a romantic view of the gift economy. Nowadays
their prestations are compulsory if they want to keep their jobs
or gain promotion (ability to teach can be irrelevant). Papers can
be fiercely rejected by others, the demands to present can mean
that papers get given before they are ready. The person who can
write fast has an advantage over those who prefer to be more considered.
Academics may act to support their own friends and followers and
reduce prestations by enemies or strangers and so on. Prestations
are embedded within fields of power and contestation, and are not
independent of them. Such economies can be both competitive and
unstable, or even act counter to some of the needs of people, and
are thus vulnerable to certain types of collapse. Both features
are the case with prestation economies on the Internet.

Prestation economies can recognise intertwined ownership. Thus
when Malinowski describes the case of ownership for canoes in the
Trobriand Islands prestation economy, although he specifically states
that a canoe will have an owner, ownership of a canoe is complex
as are the claims that people may have to use a particular canoe.
<blockquote>Ownership ... is defined by the manner in which the object is
made, used and regarded by the group of men who produced it and
enjoy its possession... in using the craft every joint owner has
a right to a certain place in it and to certain duties, privileges
and benefits associated with it ... it is the sum of duties, privileges
and mutualities which bind the joint owners to the object and
to each other. (Malinowski, 1926: 19-20)</blockquote>
Likewise, in an email list, mails are public prestations, they
are given freely, they are not "for sale", there is no
fixed value which calls for immediate return, the author's stack
of gifts is not diminished by someone else using them, nor is any
status amidst the group which was gained by the prestation lost
if another uses them elsewhere. Indeed, to some extent the reverse
might happen. It is also exceedingly difficult to maintain, or accumulate
anything, which we might call Capital and equally difficult to dissipate
any accumulation.

In much email parts of the "property" of others is overtly
embedded within the "property" of the current writer and
contributes to making its final form or even its existence. A form
of group ownership is constructed through almost every mail which
makes the exchange. We might say, that like the Trobriand canoe,
these mails only existent because of a web of connections and contributions.

If Internet societies originally held that, or behave in such a
way as to function as if, information was a matter of prestation
then attempts to model information as "property for sale or
to be owned" destroys these models and the society changes,
as surely as tribal or prestation based societies changed under
capitalism. Intertwined mail, forwards and accounts of other writings,
even references to web sites, become subject to the demands of ownership
and copyright. A person on the Internet discussion list that I study
wrote:
<blockquote>Some one has suggested that I copyright that thing that wrote
itself last night, and this reopens an old thought-box. We discussed
this, here, a long time ago, and it was my opinion that if I posted
something to the List, it was a 'gift' (something like that....).
Well, somebody seems to be thinking $$, here, and suddenly I ain't
so pure and generous any more. How does one copyright something
retroactively? I mean – it would burn my butt if somebody *else*
made money from my sweat without my permission ..... ;). (Rose
Mulvale, 1996; ellipses in original)</blockquote>
It has also been the case that over the time between 1994 and the
present day (late 2003) that members of this list have become far
more concerned about the "ownership" of the words they
submit to the list, often on the grounds that they make their living
through their words. The idea that a mailing list is a public domain
seems to be becoming less common than it was. Therefore the model
of the information society/economy with its emphasis on confined
intellectual property, may in itself be hostile to these traditions
of free exchange, in that it changes the ways people who use this
model can behave, from the "inside" as it were.

It changes messages from prestation to property.

The prestation economy can also be co-opted by the use of gifts
which bind people to a system – an example being the ubiquitous
cds which give access to the Internet through a particular company
only.

This kind of economy resembles that of the construction of the
original Internet software, as people did not appropriate it for
themselves, but gave it freely in exchange for the recognition of
a peer group. It became what Lessig (2001) has called a creative
commons, and the effect of this can be seen in the rapidity with
which the Internet was developed and in the rapid adaptation of
technically proficient hacks.
<h2>Free Software and Open Source</h2>
As is customary in Internet discussions there is a great deal of
heat about the difference between these two types of software licences.
In both cases a main idea is that the source code of software should
be available, and users should be able to modify or improve that
software.

Richard Stallman is usually considered to be the guru of the free
software movement. He makes plain he is not talking about 'free'
in terms of 'free product' but in terms of 'freely modifiable',
'freely usable' and 'freely transferable'. Source code should not
be secret, and these conditions should be passed on to all subsequent
users of the software (Gnu 1). People could still retain copyright
over their code to stop others making it propriety software, and
must not use patents (Gnu 2). It appears that the default under
US law is not that something is public domain, but that it is privately
owned. His model is essentially that of western science – the open
distribution and criticism of work. Stallman argues that:
<blockquote>The US Constitution says that copyright exists "to promote
the progress of science". When copyright impedes the progress
of science, science must push copyright out of the way. (Richard
Stallman, 2001)</blockquote>
Open source supporters, such as Bruce Parens and Eric Raymond,
seem to be a lot less insistent on the lack of secrecy or the transmission
of "freedoms". All that they require is that the source
code be made available – you are not forced to pass on the rights
you had. In some cases, under an open source licence the modifications
made to the program can become the exclusive property of the vendor
of the program. In other words, open source allows appropriation
of common work and some companies may only make a part of their
software open source.

Raymond argues that open source and post-industrial capitalism
are natural allies, and that making something open source increases
the detection of errors and promotes reliability – however efficiency
under capitalism is not the same as openness, as has been argued
above. Raymond's ease would seem to depend on the assumption that
our society will always choose the survival, and possibly the maximal
happiness, option. There is no necessity for this.

Raymond then argues that a prestation economy can only function
when people are free of the constraints of survival (1999). This
is not exactly true as many prestation economies function to distribute
goods necessary for survival in fairly harsh conditions, but it
probably is true that capitalism tends to prevent prestation economies
acting as the major mechanism of survival. The prestation economies
of the Internet depend on people being able to survive externally
of the exchange. The more that people working in universities, for
example, come to depend upon corporate support, and the more they
have to earn funds (survival) by selling ideas or the products of
ideas, the less this will be the case. To a large extent the prestation
economy of the Internet came into being only because of State support
– of the technical corporate sector and the universities. The more
the State is rolled back from this kind of support the less it will
be able to function that way.

Whatever the case, the open source license with less insistence
on "freedom" (other than getting free labour on your product),
is certainly more successful with business, as it allows appropriation
of work in the public domain and retains capitalist property rights.

Open source proponents often accuse Stallman of being too idealistic
and point out that their techniques have been much more successful
in selling the idea to the corporate world. IBM, for example, now
actively promotes the open source operating system Linux. Others
accuse Stallman, who does appear to hold left wing political positions,
of being communist – something he repeatedly denies, but it shows
the vehemence with which the possibilities of changing the role
of intellectual property can be denounced. Stallman himself alleges
that discussions of ethics and freedom make people uncomfortable
and is not acceptable to business (Stallman, 2000). As Lessig writes:
<blockquote>Microsoft has waged a war against the GPL [[General Public Licence]],
warning whoever will listen that the GPL is a "dangerous"
license. The dangers it names, however, are largely illusory.
Others object to the "coercion" in GPL's insistence
that modified versions are also free. But a condition is not coercion.
If it is not coercion for Microsoft to refuse to permit users
to distribute modified versions of its product Office without
paying it (presumably) millions, then it is not coercion when
the GPL insists that modified versions of free software be free
too. (Lessig, 2002)</blockquote>
Certain types of compulsion can be promoted as the freedoms of
free enterprise – the flexibility demanded of workers is not
applied to corporate property, which fits in with the general capitalist
view of extending the grip on property. We have seen recently in
the free trade negotiations with the US that extension of copyright
was not seen as a restriction of trade but health regulations were
(Cochrane, 2003: 1). Furthermore, it seems from SCO's recent attempts
to sue IBM for 3 billion dollars over allegations that IBM's version
of Linux includes propriety code that a war is on over this issue
(Philipson, 2003).
<h2>Hacker Ethic</h2>
As already mentioned, the public domain of the Internet, outside
the widespread and already existing commercial networks, was constructed
largely through the sharing of information between programmers,
often without much regard for secrecy or the conventions of capitalist
property. The method of calling for Request for Comments (RFCs)
encapsulated this kind of informal organisation based on technical
prowess and socially evaluated solutions to problems. This openness
was also true of the software, browser and application, which led
to the World Wide Web (Berners-Lee, 1999). Raymond suggests that
most software (95%) is essentially not written for sale and is in
house and open to programmers within the company (1999). In other
words, some kind of openness and support is behind most programming.
Such an approach to software might be called part of the "hacker
ethic".

This could be seen as extended to almost all workers in the "information
economy". For example, Wark says 'I think everyone who actually
creates "intellectual property" could consider themselves
part of the same class – the hacker class – and as having
convergent interests' (Christopher, 2002). Wark does recognise the
potential conflict of interest between such workers and corporate
ownership of their product. He calls the corporate sector the vectoralist
class – but it is unclear what this adds to anything other than
veiling – after all the vectoralist class and the corporate
class are very much the same people. Perhaps Wark uses "Capitalist"
to mean "Industrial Capitalist"? Wark praises "hackers"
as the new class:
<blockquote>Hacker knowledge implies, in its practice, a politics of free
information, free learning, the gift of the result to a network
of peers. Hacker knowledge also implies an ethics of knowledge
subject to the claims of public interest and free from subordination
to commodity production. Hacker knowledge is knowledge that expresses
the virtuality of nature, by adding to it, fully aware of the
bounty and danger. (Wark, <em>Hacker Manifesto 2.0</em>)</blockquote>
In a recent book Himanen has attempted to rewrite Max Weber's <em>Protestant
Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism for the Information Age</em> (1958),
and suggest that, as the "Protestant ethic" was important
for the development of capitalism so the "hacker ethic"
will determine the new age to come. The hacker ethic is described
as being self-consciously about passionate, freely organised work,
and the cooperation of individuals in free ways to produce new goods
(Himanen, 2001a: vii, 3-7). The hacker ethic is also held to be egalitarian
and in favour of free communication and privacy (54, 99). This new
conglomeration of ideals is supposed to produce a new society expressing
those kinds of features.

There seem several problems with such a set of propositions. Firstly,
it seems to totally misread Weber. Secondly, Himanen can only make
his argument by asserting that many features of the information
society have nothing to do with the world hackers live in.

To deal with the first point first. Weber never argued that Protestants
believed in hard work and therefore produced capitalism. Weber's
argument, to simplify it, was that capitalism was helped to develop
its particular forms through the unintended consequences of certain
Protestant ideals, which drove people in directions they might not
have otherwise gone. It is the unintended consequences that have
effect, not the conscious ones (Weber, 1958). So to analyse the
effect of hackers we must look at their actual behaviours and driving
values, and consider what kinds of unintended consequences they
might have.

For example, somewhat oddly, in the debate about the book on Slashdot.org
(which, if anywhere, is the home of those who wish to be the programming
elite), there was great preoccupation with the meaning of the word
"hacker". There was continuing indignation that "others"
could not understand that "hacker" meant 'nifty programmer'
or the equivalent, not 'person who breaks into computers' (Slashdot
1, Slashdot 2).

However, if a word is taken by everyone else to mean something
then, if you actually want to communicate, why not use another word?
What is wrong with the "programmer ethic", or the "nerd
ethic"? Levy's Hackers, which slashdotters frequently claim
to be a good book, shows the ambiguity of the word was there from
the start. Levy writes that "hack" 'may have been suggested
by ancient MIT lingo – the word "hack" had long been used
to describe the elaborate college pranks that MIT students would
regularly devise' (1994: 23ff). In normal speech, to "hack
something apart" is to demolish something crudely, to "hack
something together" is to assemble something ingeniously but
crudely. The OED gives "hacked" as contemporary US slang
meaning 'annoyed or frustrated (ie "hacked off")'. Then
the OED quotes Byte magazine as deriving the term from a Yiddish
expression meaning someone who makes furniture with an axe – this
bit of folk etymology seems unlikely, but it still maintains the
edgy violence of the word.

The inability of large numbers of slashdotter's to accept the current
normal meaning of the word, suggests that hackers are either often
fairly inflexible, or have a tendency to disregard the uses of those
who are not also hackers.

Hence, there has to be some suspicion of the egalitarianism of
the hacker ethic. As a technical egalitarianism, it may only encourage
the equality of "those who know what they are doing",
and this might be a fairly limited subset of human activities: programming,
fighting (in abstract), gaming, doing hard science, writing SF or
fantasy perhaps. The rest of the world can go hang, while this particular
elite gets on with the job.

Illustrating these different perceptions Hardy (1996) sees the
initial ARPANET community as village-like and informal in its customs,
but Vallee, who had contact with it, writes it was:
<blockquote>guarded by the puffery of high priests, the sanctity of passwords
and confidential phone numbers, the ARPA Network thinks of itself
as the very exclusive province of a few geniuses. (Vallee, 1982:
116)</blockquote>
Perhaps both reactions are possible and compatible. It has one
appearance when viewed internally and another when viewed externally.

In an interview in <em>alphabetstreet</em>, Himanen stresses the
difference between the hacker ethic and the Protestant ethic in
respect to work:
<blockquote>The Protestant work ethic teaches us that no matter what your
work consists of you should see it as your most important duty
in life ... In opposition to that, hackers devote their lives
to doing something that is their passion, i.e., something that
they find intrinsically interesting, exciting and joyous. They
do something in which they can be creative, realize themselves,
and constantly grow. This is totally different from the Protestant
ethic (2001a).</blockquote>
In other words, Himanen sees devoting your life to work while being
miserable as the Protestant ethic, while devoting your life to work
and enjoying it as the hacker ethic. In both cases the vocation
and the obsession are there. Both could fit with the features of
the information society that we have discussed. We might argue that
the Protestant Ethic at least suggests that there are things outside
work (even holy and special things), whereas this seems beyond the
hacker ethic entirely, you work whenever you can. No rest, no leisure,
no contemplation. Life is a Regime of Total Work. In his book, Himanen
tries to distinguish information age total work from hacker work,
but he can only do this by ignoring the conditions that most knowledge
workers live in (see Lessard and Baldwin). No one denies the elite
have freedoms.

The hacker attitude to power is also quite strange. Apart from
denying they are interested in power, while insisting that everyone
else use their tools and their words, they seem unlikely to be able
to recognise power, or resist power that is not of the type that
they use. Levy reports that the supposedly free wheeling Hackers,
who resisted locked doors, accepted security when faced with the
anti-war protests which might disrupt their work (1994: 130-33).
Similarly some of the Hacker "Community" seem to have
rushed to help the FBI and CIA find ways of spying upon the general
populace after September 11 (Ryle, 2003: 25-30).

In the light of this, it is not strange that Himanen, in the same
interview, can argue that the Internet 'was not built by corporations
and governments but by some passionate individuals who shared their
creations freely with others'(2001b). This is a remarkable omission. The
Internet was a result of a complex series of interactions between
governments, academic bodies, the military, corporations, technicians
and programmers. All of these groups had different objectives and
interests. Remove one of them and things might have been considerably
different, but no one of them was completely determinate of the
outcome. The fact that hackers can proclaim they built the Internet
all by themselves, emphasises the ease with which they can overlook
the rest of society, which perhaps does not indicate a democratic
attitude.

Himanen considers that the copyrighting of everything is a problem,
but seems to think that because this is inefficient it will eventually
fall down.
<blockquote>If you make some great technological innovation, you must open
it enough to get others join in within six months or otherwise
you are left alone with outdated technology. So even if you just
want to win the competition, the best strategy for your greedy
goals is not closedness but openness. (2001b)</blockquote>
This has not been the case for Microsoft, but Himanen is suggesting
political action is never necessary, leave it to the market (which
simply means leave it to the powerful). But what if the copyright
holders don't care, or do not see that openness is good for them
(as when the patenting of natural phenomena is allowed because without
it there would be no investment, or little profit), and everything
collapses because no one can innovate?

Similarly the demands of the market may shape the long term behaviour
of Hackers rather than the other way round. As Himanen points out
Bill Gates was once a hacker, and so was Steve Jobs (2001a: 56).
The Winner Take All model suggests that it is only an elite few
hackers who will have the freedom and creative power that he celebrates,
the rest will work with increasing demands on time, increasing surveillance,
and increasing Taylorisation.

It is not clear how hacker concerns for freedom of information
and privacy actually mesh up. Perhaps again it translates into privacy
for those who know how, and openness for everyone else. I've heard
programmers express total incomprehension about privacy fears, because
we can all easily use PGP if it worries us. Here the "hacker"
that they don't wish to know about surfaces again – the person who
"liberates" information about you, without your consent.
Again a fairly steep divide is suggested in practice between those
who are programmers or those who can afford programmers, and everyone
else. Is the "hacker ethic", then, a potential slaveowner's
ethic? 'Others can do the other work we need to survive, ours is
the work of citizens'.

In contrast to Himanen's arguments about freedom of information
and the hacker ethic, we have argued that the birth of the information
age is connected with the reestablishment of restrictions on the
flow of information in science and in art through copyright, and
the introduction of the copyrighting of naturally occurring phenomena
like genes.

As we all know, universities and research institutes, which have
previously been the home of this kind of free exchange of ideas
are being remodelled on corporate lines, and becoming more dependent
on corporations. Ideas which are generated in universities frequently
become the property of the corporations who contribute some sponsorship
to the projects, and they can no longer be freely circulated or
even, in some cases, divulged. A monolithic ideology of corporatism,
in which corporate business procedures are the only ways of organising,
can be seen to be replacing any idea, or practice, that perhaps
different kinds of organisation need different types of organising.

It is also not the case that the sharing of information between
hackers is the same as providing information for everyone else.
Often elites share things while unintentionally (at best) keeping
them secret from others.
<h2>The Internet and Politics</h2>
The Internet has frequently been seen as potential transformer
of politics. Often it has been seen as an anarchy. However, as any
human group will seek order and convention in order to resolve communicative
ambiguity, any anarchy is potentially an order evolving through
conflict, rhetoric and action. In that sense, and in the sense that
online communities do not often intersect with prevention of offline
survival, Internet societies are largely free of permanent imposition.
However this may not scale up to <em>offline</em> politics as is often
argued – orders of magnitude with the involvement of location and
survival may change things.

In the faceless world of pure text (or "pure mind"),
it has been often held that an argument would stand or fall by its
own virtues rather than by the social markers of those who enunciated
it. Similarly, many have argued that Totalitarian States could not
survive the coming of the Internet as information would be freely
available and censorship (of the "truth") would not be
viable. In other words the Internet has often been seen as a democratising
force providing good information.

More subtly, Poster suggests that the Internet is 'underdetermined'
because it is open, does 'not direct agents into clear paths', and
encourages 'social construction and cultural creation'. It is 'overdetermined
in the sense of being structured through multiple contradictory
practices but is also underdetermined in the sense that it remains
an invitation to a new imaginary' (Poster, 2001: 18). The Internet
is transgressive because it enables instantaneous many to many communications,
dislocates communication from the space of the nation, and accelerates
'postmodern' subjectivities (16).

However, Best and Kellner (2003) suggest that the experience of
postmodern themes (entropy, chaos, indeterminacy, contingency, simulation,
and hyperreality) could be a product of a society not in formation
but in disintegration. It might also seem that this position is
easily co-opted by the Corporate Right – no need to make any social
change, or work for a fairer distribution of the proceeds of groupwork,
let's just provide everyone with a computer.

More seriously, the idea that the Internet might encourage multiplicity
might be inaccurate, more a way to sell postmodernism than a description
of what happens. My own research of online subjectivity suggested
that people were far more concerned about determining the real authenticity
of the other, or uncovering their "truth", than they were
in allowing them to play with multiple identities. Any observed
multiplicity was regarded as an addition to a person's real nature,
not real in itself – it was often regarded as automatically deceitful
in some sense. Thus people quested for bodily information (particularly
"correct gender"), and assumed that a person's words had
one real meaning, which was easy to obtain, and that people could
be inserted into fairly straightforward categories such as 'male'
or 'female', 'Democrat' or 'Republican' etc.

Poster adds that there is 'the possibility of developing a level
of global interconnectedness that is outside the aegis of both the
nation-state and the transnational corporation' (Poster, 2001: 118).
Leaving aside the issue of whether this actually gives any potential
for further democracy as opposed to warring extremisms, the corporate
or State sectors may have more power to regulate imaginings and
interconnectedness than he assumes. It may be that the configuration
allowed by the Internet is not that beneficial either, as revealed
in actual usage. We cannot assume that interconnectedness produces
dialogue. Communication is difficult and fraught with danger. Not
all communication is <em>good</em> communication or particularly beneficial
(Marshall, 2002).

Even a limited experience of Internet discussion groups shows that
when political issues are invoked, groups tend to polarise, erupt
into flame and abuse, and break apart with the loss of those who
feel in the minority position. In addition, discussions evoking
controversy can result in an inhibition of the issues in order to
preserve peace and to avoid flooding the group "space"
with a volume of messages greater than members can handle. It is
rare to get discussion moving towards a position informed by all
sides – it is much more common to see existing positions move further
apart. Partly this problem arises from the ease of separation (no
one has to cooperate), and partly it arises because the issue of
who says something is important to how the message is interpreted.

Communication is always ambiguous, always a matter of interpretation,
being resolved by the ways the message is given context, and this
context involves identifying the participants. Online, when the
only identity markers are widespread clichés or generalisations,
and exceptions to the clichés can be unperceived, these markers
may take on a strength even greater than they have offline, irrespective
of their relevance to the discussion. In effect, the markers of
class, social position, race, gender and political ideology become
ways of providing context for interpretation, as are, perhaps in
different ways, the effects of education, personal style and amount
of time that a person has free to participate. Even if it is proposed
that online people's presentation of their race/ethnicity or gender
can be fluid, this does not imply the categories themselves are
fluid. It may be that the common denial of the effects of these
markers tends to give them more influence. If you argue that you
are disadvantaged by such a marker, it tends to produce strident
denials by those on the more favourable side of the divide, and
the deniers become even less likely to listen to the person's arguments.
I have witnessed this on many occasions, particularly around the
effects of gender and race, even in places where you might expect
people to hold leftish political views. <a class="sidenav2" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080704102350/http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue1/issue1_marshall.html#11">[11]</a>
<a name="return11"></a>

Furthermore, the power basis of a society is not circumvented,
as power still legitimates arguments, has greater possibility of
physical retaliation, and allows greater spread and repetition of
messages. Besides, Internet groups are not without power hierarchies.
A power base can provide income for people to spread propaganda
and to organise others to respond. Thus, corporations can sue dissenting
websites or their ISPs, or plant messages disguised as discussion
or recommendation. They can also start up discussion groups and
pay people to both propagandise and entertain, and remove those
who object too strongly. Groups can organise to protest against
media who they feel distort their position, and the more power those
groups have offline, the more this power will translate into suppression
of discussion.

Message boards run by media organisations to facilitate political
debate, can tend to ban topics or arguments they consider unsuitable
as happened with the New York Times in the days after Sept 11 2001
(Bressers, 2003: 16). The more that maintaining the return rate
of posters, or the 'community', is important, the more debate may
tend to be suppressed – either voluntarily or by fiat.

We might define power ratios in terms of the ease of activation
of particular pathways of response. In which case the established
order will always tend to be dominant unless new pathways can be
established (particularly if outside of the ken of the dominant
order) or if older pathways become less stable, less efficient,
or disrupted. In the case of the Internet it looks, at this moment,
as if the Internet is strengthening the proclivities of corporate
dominance faster than it might increase possible alternatives. Perhaps
the only resistance, however disastrous, might be in fundamentalisms,
which give an even stronger sense of group identity.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Partly the idea that the Internet increases democracy is supported
by the idea that information is a good thing, but information is
only "good" when it is as accurate as it can be, easy
to recognise and easy to find. As I have argued, this is not the
case. Validation often depends on some kind of existent authority,
which depends on the power system. People with one set of views
tend to accept reports supporting those views and be less concerned
about the validity of these sources than they would be of opposing
views – partly because they fit in with presuppositions, but partly
because repetition counts as truth. The polarisation occurring in
Internet debate is likely to heighten this acceptance and dismissal.
Again the ultimate tendency would be to support the existing powers.
Most cases in which these existing powers have been affected tend
to be in those issues concerning engineering and technical competency
in which a decisive and limited market has objected strenuously
to a particular technical failing (such as the inaccurate arithmetic
in one Intel processor) or support the spread of Linux. This effect
does not seem to have translated, at this moment, into more widespread
politics.

Although the Internet has been used with some effect to organise
the movement for social justice and the anti-war movement in the
US, it has not been able to compensate for either the type, or lack,
of publicity given to its actions in the wider media. Those who
know are those who already know. The easily organised mass protests
against the War in Iraq did not stop people apparently supporting
their governments and the war, when it formally began.

To some extent the lack of democratising effect with the Internet
is to be expected as we live in a society of increasing inequality
in power and wealth, in which the basis of that wealth is threatened
by economic and social collapse, terrorism and ecological catastrophe.
The response of the modern State has been to become more stringent
in its regulations of lower classes, and less inclusive of them.
This represents a change from the historic patterns of increasing
inclusion, moving to attempt to compensate for power differences.

It is to be expected that the Internet would be largely immersed
in this culture. This does not mean that it cannot become something
other merely that it has many obstacles to overcome and is not inherently,
of itself, radical. These obstacles include the political weakness
of knowledge workers in the work place; the expansion of corporate
power through extension of property regimes; the vulnerability of
creative commons and free exchange to this expansion; the profusion
of inaccurate data; and the ineffectiveness of the current ways
of organising communication on the net to produce discussion.

to Fritz Machlup in 1962 (Drucker 1968: 263). It might be possible
to suggest that business, or management, oriented writers have found
the information society idea, extremely attractive – much more so
than most academic ideas.

<a name="3"></a>[3] For example, Angell (2001), Dale Davidson,
David and Rees-Mogg, William (1993, 1997). The number of business
books saying the future is in the information economy is almost
endless. The same kind of view seems to be taken by Castells who
treats deregulation favourably (2001: 168, 172-3).

<a name="4"></a>[4] Summary based on Dyer-Witheford (1999: 22-6),
Castells (1996: 61-2, 135, 154-5, 164, 217, 268). Nearly all of
these points were made by Toffler in (1980).

<a name="5"></a>[5] In his explicitly economic essays Hume portrays
the value of commodities as a complex interaction between 1) the
quantity and type of the medium of exchange, 2) the labour "stored"
in the product, and 3) the valuation of that labour by those dominant
in that society. See 'Of Commerce', 'Of Money', 'Of Interest', 'Of
Refinement in the Arts', in Hume (1987).

<a name="6"></a>[6] Much has been written about this, but for an
interesting attempt to relate inequalities to geography and power
within and between countries, see Beaverstock et al who write: 'These
figures lead to the staggering conclusion that the top 0.25% of
the world's population owns as much wealth as the other 99.75%'.

<a name="7"></a>[7] Poster himself quotes Scot on VOODOO, an automatic
email monitor, which 'even discouraged irony and sarcasm', and Miller
on Yahoo's attempt to regulate users.

<a name="8"></a>[8] Bagdikian (2000) and Alger (2000) argue that
the media is now largely controlled by 10-12 international media
corporations and this restricts the type of comment available. The
same columns get run in different newspapers. However Compaine,
and Gomery (2000) argue there is more diversity and niche marketing.

<a name="9"></a>[9] The rightist commentators mentioned above,
tend to focus on specific incidents and never ask how reports which
might favour a more leftist, or critical, position might also not
appear or be relegated to minor status.

<a name="10"></a>[10] The anthropological data and analysis of
prestation economies is extensive. See Marshall (2000: chapter 9)
for some analysis in the context of the Internet – especially in
terms of existential issues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 The epistemic method founded in Meditation One of Descartes’s Meditations on First Philosophy has this as its object: to remove any possible doubt so that certainty, or indubitability, of certain truths, whatever they may be, might be obtained. The meditator has certainty as his goal, not knowledge. Certainty makes “sure knowledge” possible, and without it, there are no viable routes to attaining any knowledge.

1.1 For the meditator, knowledge and certainty are distinguished from each other in this way.

1.11 “But perhaps, even though the senses do sometimes deceive us when it is a question of very small and distant things, still there are many other matters concerning which one simply cannot doubt, even though they are derived from the very same senses: for example, that I am sitting here next to the fire, wearing my winter dressing gown, that I am holding this sheet of paper, and the like. But on what grounds could one deny that these hands and this entire body are mine?” (M 18; my emphasis)

1.2 Knowledge is that which can be doubted; certainty, or knowledge which is certain, is that which cannot. The concluding question attempts to doubt what the meditator asserts “one cannot doubt.” We seem to be forced to interpret the usage of “doubt” as a possible equivocation, or we can devise two forms of doubt: I will call them “restricted domain doubt” and “universal domain doubt”.

1.21 Restricted domain refers to propositions, as inferred from the quote at 1.11, which can be doubted only if the meditator can sufficiently doubt a “universal domain”; e.g. “The sky is above me”, “A kitten is on my keyboard right now”, “I have two feet”, etc would be doubted only if their corresponding universal domain is successfully doubted.

1.211 The proposition “I have two feet” and my knowledge of it carries no weight in showing the nature of my knowledge of a universal domain because the proposition could be uttered during my presence within any universal domain. The resemblance thesis later explained at 1.42 will justify this claim further.

1.22 Universal domain refers to propositions, as inferred from the concluding question at 1.11, which implicate the meditator’s entire experiential domain to doubt. e.g. “This is not my body”, “Suppose I am in a dream state”, “This is the waking world”, etc.

1.221 Doubts of the universal domain kind entail that one does not know for certain the truth or falsity of any restricted domain. 

1.222 A universal domain may have a history (“Bill Clinton was the U.S. President in 1995”, etc), its own set of physical laws, experiential facts, etc; a universal domain is a possible world of experiences, i.e. your sensory perceptions, your memories, etc.

1.223 The nature of a universal domain and its relation to the meditator’s perception is this: Any universal domain can provide experiential data to the meditator.

1.3 To obtain the knowledge, or, in this case, certainty, of the meditator’s present universal domain entails at least possible knowledge of restricted domains (e.g. “This is a hand”) which constitute the makeup that universal domain. That is, knowledge of the meditator’s universal domain (e.g. “I know that I am not dreaming”) entails certainty, and certainty entails possible certain knowledge of restricted domain propositions, which are within that universal domain.

1.31 “…which are within that universal domain” would imply that “dreaming” universal domains, say, would have no relevancy (true or false) to one’s actual, or “waking”, universal domain. The propositions might be true for that “dreaming” universal domain, but you have determined, or come to know, that you are not dreaming.

1.4 It is possible, or thinkable, that universal domains can be exactly experientially alike; that is, universal domains may consist of a multiplicity of restricted domains (the knowledge of kittens, hands, facts, etc) which are persuasively indistinguishable when displaced, supposedly, to other universal domains. 

1.41 “As if I did not recall having been deceived on other occasions even by similar thoughts in my dreams… I see so plainly that there are no definitive signs by which to distinguish being awake from being asleep” (M 19).

1.42 The strength of this resemblance thesis is twofold: (a) “no definitive signs” would imply that the “dreaming” universal domain might include the memory of the meditator’s history (past dreaming events, what was eaten for lunch, etc) which would not work as “definitive” indicators that one is not dreaming, and (b) there is no actual knowledge because, due to the lack of a “definitive sign”, it is indistinguishable that one is in the “waking” universal domain or the “dreaming” universal domain.

1.43 Knowledge within the supposed “dreaming” universal domain cannot be granted unless the meditator has ascertained which universal domain he resides in at the moment. The fact that the meditator does not know that he is not in the “dreaming” universal domain entails that the meditator does not know certain restricted domain propositions which are included in that domain or possibly another. For all the meditator knows, he could be a lobster which is dreaming that he is a human with hands. To know the antecedent of that entailment is the only condition by which the meditator can justify any knowledge-claim about restricted domain propositions.

1.431 From this, we understand clearly now that a restricted domain’s truth or falsity is contingent on our knowledge, which would be certainty, of our presence in the “waking” universal domain. 

1.432 The evident claim is this: it is that only certainty (of our universal domain) gives us justification of restricted domain knowledge-claims.

1.5 The Dream argument is stated (using the previous terms): Suppose that you are dreaming (“dreaming” universal domain). Dreaming, as it has before, has impressed upon you all sorts of memories and past experiences (including that you woke up 4 hours ago after a pleasant dream, etc). If you do not know that you are not in the “dreaming” universal domain, then you do not know the restricted domains (“I have two feet”, etc) of the “waking” universal domain.

2 G.E. Moore, in his essay Certainty, advances two important counterarguments to the Dreaming hypothesis. Though they fail to achieve their object, they lay the groundwork for the arguments beginning at 3.

2.1 Moore finds that the proposition “If I do know that I am standing up, then I do know that I am not dreaming” is logically equivalent to the Dream argument’s proposition “If I do not know that I am not dreaming, it follows that I don’t know that I am standing up” (C 30).

2.11 Logical equivalence of the two propositions cannot stifle the skeptical argument because of what was said of the nature of restricted domain propositions combined with the resemblance thesis. “I do know that I am standing up” would be compatible with the “dreaming” and “waking” universal domains, and, given that these domains could be experientially (and perceptually) exactly alike, knowing that I am standing would not entail that the meditator knows his presence within a particular universal domain as opposed to another. By the Dream argument’s stipulation, Moore has proved that he knows “This is a hand” in one universal domain or “This is a hand” in another universal domain. It is logically possible that he knows either case, but it is not logically possible that he should so know at the same time. If he is dreaming, then he cannot know that he has hands. He is physically unable to even utter the proposition, which would convey that knowledge. His dream may be telling him any restricted domain proposition, which could be false, and he would not know, or be able to express his knowledge, if he were asleep. Nevertheless, even if it could be shown that the knowledge of restricted domain propositions paralleled, the mere conjunction of knowledge of restricted domains does not guarantee certainty because the proposition “You do not know that you are not dreaming” is not satisfied.

2.2 The propositions “I have these sense experiences and memories” and “I am now dreaming” (C 31), Moore claims, are logically “self-contradictory”.

2.21 “Sensory experience” and “memories” are restricted domains and would be assumed to be contained within a “dreaming” universal domain; the fact that the meditator is now dreaming combined with the resemblance thesis shows that all sensory experience and memory could be the product of that “dreaming” universal domain’s history which the meditator is a part of. 

2.211 e.g. in the “waking” universal domain, the meditator could say “I had a dream last night”. By the resemblance thesis, this utterance could possibly occur also in a “dreaming” universal domain.

2.22 Therefore, Moore’s claim of “inconsistency” as to the premise “Some at least of the sensory experiences which you are having now are similar in important respects to dream-dreams which actually have occurred in dreams” is false.

3 Moore’s counterarguments, though strong, seem to fail to get around the Dream argument’s peculiar and seemingly exhaustive reasoning. Moore’s attempts were unsuccessful because he attempted to challenge the argument strictly based on its condition that: You know restricted domain propositions only if you know that you are not in the “dreaming” universal domain. Unlike Moore, who attempted to enter and combat the argument from within, we must attempt to find a fault in the argument at its exterior, so as to determine if its condition for knowledge and certainty is actually with fault.

3.1 How did the question arise at all that: You do not know that you are not dreaming; given the resemblance thesis, could there ever be a determinant which makes this proposition truly qualify as known? If you cannot at all come to know a proposition’s truth, then it is not a proposition that can entail knowledge.

3.2 Stroud makes examples using clearly restricted domain propositions so as to illustrate the nature of the Dream arguments relevance to commonplace, natural inquiry. However, being that these are restricted domain propositions (“That was a goldfinch”, etc), they are unsuccessful at actually showing the nature of a universal domain proposition.

3.21 If you determine that a goldfinch is incompatible with being a canary, you have a thinkable and imaginable possibility that you could possibly come to know to be the case. But is this the case with universal domain propositions?

3.22 Our object here is to show that the question of the meditator’s presence within a universal domain is illegitimately raised. Questions similar it, as Stroud elucidates with his Goldfinch propositions et al, are relevant to knowledge and certainty, but this is only by virtue of the possibilities, which could exist and could be incompatible with those knowledge-claims. This form of inquiry applies only to restricted domain propositions because it is assumed also that they could have incompatible propositions. Our rule is this: If there is no way to check or assess that a proposition p, which could be incompatible with other possibly true propositions, then it is not a proposition which can give knowledge. A proposition not in concord with this rule may be raised, but its potential usage, should it be true, as knowledge is closed off and inaccessible to other propositions.

3.23 A universal domain proposition cannot be compared with any other universal domain proposition (by the resemblance thesis), and these propositions cannot give meaningful assignments of value to restricted domain propositions, which are arranged within its “world” or “history”. Knowing the truth or falsity of the universal domain proposition assures nothing except itself; and, should we know its truth, it cannot explain how restricted domain propositions came to possess their values, why they maintain their values, etc.

3.231 e.g. knowing that I am not dreaming only give me certainty that I am not dreaming and that I am in a world that has restricted domain propositions, which I can affirm or deny and might be different from the “waking” universal domain. But if I wish to know why I have hands in this way as opposed to why I do not have hands in the way that holds in my dream, I cannot compare the propositions because they could possibly resemble each other exactly. But is not the true aim of this investigation knowledge and certainty?

3.232 If universal domains could possibly resemble each other exactly, then universal domain propositions, which only seek to determine their own truth or falsity, cannot be used during our investigation of restricted domain propositions. If our task is knowledge and certainty, we will reject the legitimacy of a proposition that seeks to cater to and entertain only itself.

"The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things."

<strong>Conatus Principle</strong>
"Each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being."

<strong>Value of Ontological Entities</strong>
A thing is good because it is desired.

<strong>Identity</strong>
In essence, a thing's definition does not involve anything contrary to itself--that would destroy it. But further, the question is raised: It is not so evident that a thing's lack of involving something counter to it would also involve that thing's persevering. (But does this question presuppose that things "will" to persevere? Could it not be that "persevere" is used as a statement of affairs--"that thing merely continues to be in a way in which I perceive." As opposed to "I (a human) <em>will</em> to persevere in this way, and thus I do by my efforts." Are we ascribing "will" to things such as rocks? Can we say something perseveres without couching in the idea of "will?")

Aside from those quibbles, by what <em>means</em> does a thing persevere? Internal positation of itself, or inclination to posit itself, against all other entities, presumably or by finititude, not therein its defintion or ontological identity. We ought to equate "persevere" with "posit." "No thing can be destroyed except through an external cause." "Through" might seem a bit ambiguous. What are the <em>ways</em> in which things might be destroyed, under the framing of things external to it? Can we posit externals without also presupposing that those things must, actually, be within the questioned persevering thing's ontological identity?

<strong>Theory of Inherence</strong>
Finite things inhere as <em>approximations</em> of the infinite thing.

<strong>Rejection of Ends*</strong>

<strong>Error Theory of Ethics</strong>
<em>Speaker Relativity</em> (linguistic relational)
<em>Correlativity</em> (Parallel Presupposition Relational)
<em>Model Relativity</em> (As far as conceived "God's image" relational, or Flirtation with Platonic Forms)

<strong>Language as a Mode of Thinking (Remembering)</strong>
Which words elicit the most accurate approximation of Deus sive Natura?

<strong>Aesthetic Values as Modes of Thinking (Remembering)</strong>

<strong>Principle of Sufficient Reason</strong>
<em>Assumption:</em> Efficient causation is ontologically primary.
All contingent (efficiently caused) facts must be explainable.

<strong>Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles</strong>
If two things are distinct, there must be an explanation for their nonidentity or we must be able to conceive of them as distinct.

<strong>Different Modes Problem</strong>
Put shared modes to the side because substances are prior to their modes.

Substance A { modes: X, Y, Z }
Substance B { modes: X, Y, Z }

<strong>Different Attributes Problem</strong>
Conceptual barrier

Substance A { attributes: T, E }
Substance B { attributes: T, Z }

		<title>Abortion Positioning as Performative Contradiction</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night my friend and I shared a discussion over abortion stances. The topic was introduced by me, as I find myself constantly debating the matter in my mind. Often I find my opinion sharing sentiments with that of pro-choice <em>debaters.</em> Why do I frame it that way, with "debaters?" Well, for this reason: I thought I had stumbled--despite my usual inclination--onto the ultimate pro-life argument. But then again, could it be the quintessential pro-choice argument? In any case, it seems like the basis of this argument, which I will draw out later, centers on the speech acts and knowledge, which both necessarily appear on the communicative stage of debate.

So how did our discussion go? Well, I opened with an Aristotle Says* line of argument with Peter Singer as the source. His argument is essentially pragmatism backed by scientism. (I'm not tossing insults yet!) 

Look, let's <em>at least</em> be scientifically consistent, a 12 week old fetus has no cognitive self-awareness (no concept of self) nor does it have any sensory perception (cannot feel pain). By the way, it's debatable that non-human animals do not have emotions. Darwin believed they did, but in differences of degree with respect to humans, not in accessible "kinds" of emotions. The degrees, so to, vary between species, from bacteria all the way up to the "top" of the ladder (homo sapiens sapiens, presumably).

I throw this in as an aside because although I am vegetarian already, a troublesome event occurred during out abortion debate. As we were arguing our cases, I noticed a cat peering in through the window, with its little paw on the ledge of it. The cat seemed to be investigating the 

 Physically, the fetus may have potential to <em>become</em> a fully conscious human being, but, comparatively, to an already fully conscious human being (the mother), certain and definite judgment can be made in favor of abortion. If that's the case, <em>personhood</em> does not apply to the fetus. The case of potentiality is really irrelevant. Let's talk about what's actual. So, it's ethically permissible for a mother to choose to undergo an abortion. In fact, it's permissible for the State to allow doctor-patient confidentiality so that, in effect, abortion procedures can follow through <em>carefully,</em> <em>safely,</em> and <em>privately.</em>

I was swayed to this view. However, my friend argued this:

<blockquote>(1) if you did not have a <em>choice</em> in your own birth, you should not have a <em>choice</em> in whether another birth is carried out.</blockquote>

There are some premisses here that need to be dug up. It seems the usage of "birth" implies "a human life." What does having a choice in one's own birth matter, anyway? I'm already born, and I'm looking at what's actual. By virtue of my being here, bringing this argument up is without merit.

But is it really lacking merit? It seems to suggest something logical. And further, something lacking respect for temporality. This is the essence of the pro-life argument: The matter of life is atemporal; every human being has a spirit, or soul. But let's not get too hasty and bigoted; I know the scientifically minded would love to resort to name calling at this point. Roger Wolcott Sperry notes,

<blockquote>The events of inner experience, as emergent properties of brain processes, become themselves explanatory causal constructs in their own right, interacting at their own level with their own laws and dynamics. The whole world of inner experience (the world of the humanities) long rejected by 20th century scientific materialism, thus becomes recognized and included within the domain of science.</blockquote>

Emergent vitalism is a hotly debated issue. And I don't think this pro-/anti-abortion debate can go anywhere meaningful unless people begin to sufficiently grasp of the difficulties of the aforementioned issues of vitalism. The question now becomes, "When do emergent cognitive properties of the fetus arise?" This is contingent upon when the neural properties of the fetus are developed far along enough to our arbitrary standards. The debate becomes an issue of who determines what sets the standard for human life? Pro-lifers say we have "spirits," probably due to vitalistic leanings, and pro-choice proponents say we have "politics."

Today, by United States federal law, cases with respect to protecting the pregnant woman's life, physical health, mental health, rape, fetal defects, socio-economic factors all permit abortion procedures.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nuances and Noncounters of Gettier-types (draft)</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/?p=262</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Edmund Gettier wrote and published "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" in 1963, a three-page paper that, by most modern epistemologists' judgment, demolished our most trusted normative definition of knowledge since the time of Plato, Justified True Belief.

So, you've got an introduction and the source text. Let's discuss.

I've come across various arguments against Gettier's cases; many of those argument misinterpret exactly what Gettier showed to be logically wrong with Justified True Belief as the necessary and sufficient condition for Knowledge. So, what exactly was attacked?

<strong>S knows that P</strong> if and only if 
<blockquote>(a) <strong>P is true; </strong>
(b) <strong>S believes that P</strong>; and 
(c) <strong>S is justified in believing that P</strong>.</blockquote>

Now, we must clarify exactly what is meant by "justification" because many counterarguments to Gettier which I've seen fail to understand the nature of justification qua logical inference. Justification can come from "physical evidence" or "logical inference," "matters of fact" or "by relation of ideas" (for Humeans). Justification can be established or derived by synthetic or analytic propositional statements. In effect, logical inference as justification is just as important as physical evidence as justification. Furthermore, truth-functional assignment pertains to what can be believed and what can bear justification to be believed.

For instance, I believe that "Jon is a bachelor" because "Jon is an unmarried male." My belief is true, I believe that it is true, and my justification for believing that "Jon is a bachelor" comes from my knowing that "Jon is an unmarried male." Look at it this way, "If I have justification to believe that 'Jon is an unmarried male,' then I have justification to believe that 'Jon is a bachelor.'" Thus, my evidence "Jon is an unmarried male" logically entails that "Jon is a bachelor." My initial belief entails my subsequent belief. So, by justified true belief, I bear knowledge about Jon's bachelorhood. I might wish to call this form of Justified True Belief (henceforth JTB) "Justified True Logical Inference (JTLI)," to hone in on the idea and make clear that truth-functional assignment to propositions through propositional logic, or first-order logic, is relevant and important to justified true belief.

With that out of the way, we can move to my arguments against Case I. Smith believes "Jones has ten coins in his pocket" because he examined his pocket, and Smith believes "Jones will get the job" because the president told him that Jones would. Smith concatenates those two beliefs to form proposition <strong>(1)</strong> "Jones is the man who will get the job, and Jones has ten coins in his pocket."

Now you might raise issue here: Jones doesn't actually get the job in the end, so it's just not true that Smith has a Justified True Belief. But we must keep in mind exactly which proposition fails to satisfy us in the end. The proposition is not (1) but <strong>(2)</strong>, which reads: "The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket." Smith sees the entailment of (2) based on (1) before we find out that Jones actually does not get the job. Therefore, Smith has a justified true belief of (2) by JTLI. Now, you might raise argument: "(2) is ambiguous; it could mean many things." This is quite true, however, this does not prevent us from seeing that Smith nevertheless has the belief of (2). And (2) can be subject to truth-functional assignment.

How did this belief come about? Where does this "ambiguity" come from that we intuitively feel? By existential introduction (2) is made possible. (2) means that Smith believes something like this "There is an x that is male such that x will get the job and x has ten coins in x's pocket." Essentially, (2) refers to maleness of the subject, that the subject will get the job, and that of possessing ten coins.

Even if (2) is ambiguous, that does not prevent us, as said, from seeing that it is true, justified, and believed by Smith. He is believing in an analytic proposition. "Maleness" is the predicate of the subject in question, and this is all that is being referred to. The argument cannot be raised, "well, Smith was always thinking about Jones, so he could only be referring to Jones in (2)." This is very much true, and Smith might have been. But the argument is such that Smith believes in a proposition that refers to maleness, that is, proposition (2).

My argument, however, depends on the one previously stated: when Smith sees the entailment of (2) he could not have anyone else in mind except Jones. It is not possible for him to even consider himself as a candidate because his justification rules himself out of (2). Yes, in the end, he has a JTB by JTLI, but we do not accept it as Knowledge because it just feels funny. It feels funny because we see that existential introduction seems to allow us to believe a grammatical generalization based on physical evidence not relevant to that grammatical generalization. The logical inference itself highlights the disjointed relationship analytic propositions have when considering their basis of synthetic propositions. The predicate of "maleness" holds, for all subjects in the given situational context, as true; this makes (2) true as an analytic a posteriori statement. "Maleness" is a predicate of the subject who gets the job. (1) necessarily depends on observation and retrospective analysis; thus, (1) is synthetic a posteriori.

We must ask ourselves: What is the big deal? Smith being justified in the wrong way for believing (2) after the fact is no issue. And I agree: Smith, in order for us to consider his evidence false, must have in principle been able to consider himself as the candidate to get the job. 

If he could not consider himself a candidate for the job, his (2) could not implicate himself. If you were to ask Smith what he believed, the semantic delineation would always implicate Smith. He has a justified true belief of (2), but that introduces an argument of truth-functional semantics. I am here "digging out" the assumption Gettier seems to have made about truth-functional semantics. That the semantic identity of (2) is taken to be non-existent, and not ambiguous, is my argument. Gettier wants us to look at (2) as having utterly no semantic wealth, but view it purely in terms of truth-functionality. Are beliefs only truth-functional?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>I. Grounds to Avoid in Theoretical Ethical Philosophy</strong>
Through my theoretical reflections of the nature of the State and its relation to Persons, I have found conflict of a semantic sort insofar as speech acts concerning those members of the sets involving such States and Persons. In mentioning "theoretical," I should not wish to be mistaken for endeavoring to contrive a metaphysical system of ontic relations. To involve myself with any ontology here is not my aim; but it is to conceive, as best as one might, the relation between our linguistic events with States and Persons as subjects. What sense can we make of our utterances involving States and Persons; this is the object of my undertaking. So, I shall strive to ensure that my words here do not take a metaphysical bent, for philosophy so frequently falls to error when one's mind is let loose on the mistaken grounds of grandiose themes. The fanciful nature of cognition can be an enemy when the imagination is not guided in a manner that kept bounded; it is the imagination that brings us here, giving us our impetus. It should not govern all that transpires in our thoughts. Metaphysics improper is that which the mind produces after reason is given furlough. 

<strong>II. Of the Distinction of the Necessary and the Sufficient</strong>
When we conceive the State, we wish to establish those properties of it which necessarily are conducive to the well-being and happiness of humankind. Questions concerning the State involve the demarcation of intrinsic and extrinsic political rules which dictate the relation of political contexts. For any sovereign state S, what might be considered an intrinsic rule is that of its internal legal system which controls the consequences of actions for citizens therein. Though the rule itself is constituted by a multiplicity of interoperating rules (laws), we can conceive it as relating to other internal systems (say, the rules of commerce). Therefore, the legal system is one rule of many which compose the entirety of S. The success of interoperability between rules is determined by the governmental bodies therein; we can disregard the type of governmental system, be it "democratic" or "totalitarian." If we can conceive that there is a government at all, we must conclude that through a chain of communication and deliberation, rules are thus legislated and implemented by the government itself. Governmental systems only establish the process by which rules are translated from hierarchies of power and understanding. That is, for instance, a low-class citizen, within a democratic system, contributes her vote in various elections, participatory political events, etc. 

Rules themselves function as necessary conditions, but never as sufficient, for the moral worth of S. In saying this, we mean that S becomes a context composed of necessary conditions for moral import. However, the notion of moral worth cannot involve only necessary conditions. An action, say, cannot bear moral import because it must be evaluated in terms of strictly necessary conditions. You might wondered in what respect these conditions of S can only be considered necessary: it is because of the relation S has to internal citizens and external persons. With S in mind as a sovereign state must be considered the maximal political entity of any community of persons: for a collection of presumed citizens C, S will be the theoretical extent of C's power insofar as it is conceived by every member of C. There is no political entity beyond the mind of the members of C; therefore, the rules of S for members of C must be viewed as necessary once those rules are perceived by any member of C. Members of C must refer to the rules; the principle that members of C can change the rules does not obviate the point that as a member, or citizen, of C, there is a political obligation to the rules in some sense. If that member of C were not bound to the rules in some way, the prospect of changing those rules would be of no interest to that member; therefore, that member would not be a citizen of that political system.

		<title>Talking to religious people on street corners</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While having a smoke outside one of the colleges before an exam, I noticed one of the campus proselytizers having a chat-baptism with a student. Decidedly I let my Socratic tick overcome me. I approach while grabbing for a cigarette. Just before I could light up, a friend popped up--Michael. I introduced them--Michael, Paul; Paul, Michael. The first question thrown out concerned whether Paul <em>believes</em> in our beloved evolution. I had my own question in mind, but I ran with it anyway. I warn, though, that must one be very cautious when engaging in this sort of comical pedantry not to let "evolution" be conversationally defined as something other than "the scientific theory of ..." Otherwise, you'll find yourself dealing with all sorts of generalities and shod-examples that are not even relevant to the theory as such. It will become even more comical if you see this direction of the conversation manifest and you can do nothing to steer it back to your proper, entertainment-seeking path.

Paul professed his belief in microevolution but not macroevolution. A common stance among "scientifically-initiated" proselytizers. It's a peculiar one to me because of the following claim (or whatever its variant), typically given by Paul and his ilk:

(a) The scientist believes that microevolution <em>proves</em> macroevolution.
(a1) Microevolution proves macroevolution.

This is the claim he professed is held by the "opposing view," usually the scientific materialist. Interesting that Paul's restatement of the scientific claim has this claim as its logical equivalent (after formatting it in such a way to linguistically account for truth-values):

(b) The falsity of macroevotion proves the falsity of microevolution.
(b1) If Macroevolution is false, then its falsity does not prove, or entail, the truth of Microevolution. That is, Microevolution is false.

Does the scientist ever actually make either claim? At first blush, my intuition leads me to believe the scientist makes neither.

Paul believes, however, that he logically concludes this claim, given falsity of (a1):

(c) The truth of microevolution (Q) does not prove the truth of macroevolution (Not-P).

It's logical equivalent is:

(c1) The truth of macroevolution (P) does not proves truth of microevolution (Not-Q). 

Now what Paul believes seems to be right on. But he claims that he believes it because the scientist has a false belief (i.e., P if and only if Q). Paul believes (c) and (c1). He would not think the truth of microevolution entails or is entailed by macroevolution. But he believes the scientist holds the believe P< ->Q. Paul believes this because of his claims (c) and (c1). So he gets the following argument.

<code>1 -(P< ->Q), Assumption.
2 Q, Provisional Assumption (Q->-P).
3 P, Provisional Assumption (-P).
4 P->Q, Logical Out.
5 Q->P, Logical Out.
6 Q, Modus Ponens.
7 P, Modus Ponens.
8 -P, Indirect Proof (*Not satisfied*).
9 Q->-P, Conditional Proof.</code>

As we can see, the claim purported by the scientific materials, say, as far as Paul is concerned, cannot have as a conclusion his claim (that Microevolution does not prove Macroevolution). So, it must be another assumption that he holds. This would be that Microevolution is true. This way, he gets his claim at least in principle, that Q->-P.

Take the same argument, but add truth to his atomic assumption (for the sake of being economical).

<code>1 -(P< ->Q), Assumption.
2 Q, Assumption.
3 -Q^-P, Provisional Assumption (7).
4 -Q, Conjunction Out (3).
5 Q, Reiterate (2).
6 Q^-Q, Conjunction In (4,5).
7-(-Q^-P), Indirect Proof.
8 Q->-P, some fancy derived rule that I do not feel like proving.</code>

As we can see, we did not need Assumption at 1. For Paul, Microevolution is true (based on whatever evidence) and that evidence which supports that theory is not evidence which can support Macroevolution. Again, does the scientist ever make this claim?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>If you were in the situation, would you appreciate being put out on the front page, without anyone notifying your families?</blockquote>

The situation: <em>Your own death.</em>

No! Absolutely not! I will not be charged with being too literal, uncharitable. Ask yourself what this question could possibly mean! What could this person intend to mean? Easily we interpret as <em>Would you have a journalist seek approval and consent from your family before having your photo published in a paper?</em>

We could radically interpret that question as such; we could ignore the obvious, overt religious overtone. And it ignores the situation. We're not talking about privacy. We're not talking about just another person. The person is dead. You would be dead.

Perhaps there's the chance that it ignores important thoughts going through the mind of the victim before his death. Clearly this question ignores his own opinion on the matter.

This is just loopy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["We all have moral 'sins,'" or so one says to oneself in a feeble attempt at justification. Crimes and Misdemeanors takes the backdrop of such an utterance, that which compels it, and drives it to what may be called an extremity, a moral limit. This is the standard interpretation of the film: that its author was concerned with underscoring a central figure in his moral tumult, prying into the fabric of the "moral structure" so as to arrive at a generic procedure. We see numerous argumentative forms, framed in terms of the Multiple, "What am <em>I </em>supposed to do?" -- asked of one outside of the unique situation (Jack). Such an interpretation fails to acknowledge the obvious juxtaposition of Cliff's <em>crime </em>and Judah's <em>misdemeanor</em>.

Why do I make such a twisted interpretive move? Invert the attribution of <em>les conventionnelles morale de l'histoire</em>? "I have a great murder story. Great plot... Let's say there's this man who's very successful" Landau's character frames. Judah and Cliff round off their discussion with the conclusion that the actual film we presently view is itself the bleak picture Judah set out to advance. Yet is it really? Notice the glimmer of radiance illustrated in Judah and his wife's final kiss. What is this? And apparently there's something <em>happy </em>-- and morally estimable -- in Cliff's defeat.

Why should we view Cliff's "sin" as any less subject to the consequences that conventionally would -- or religiously <em>should -- </em>befall Judah? Were their intentions not the same? Their situations not staple and in common?

The story's objective is to compare, I believe, something binding between the two characters.]]></content:encoded>

I am very glad that this post was written. It is certainly correct where the author makes this point:
<blockquote>First, Wittgenstein’s method in this case would have nothing to do with “analyzing the word ‘mind’”—this is precisely what he faulted other philosophers for doing!</blockquote>
The statement 'I don’t think the question “are there other minds?” can be settled simply by analyzing the word “mind”' is a complete misunderstanding of what Wittgensteinians engage themselves in.

Witty asserts "An 'inner process' stands in need of public criteria." Clearly he is presupposing that the meanings of words, to say the least, but specifically meaning and <em>whatever relation</em> it has to use is most significant. Can this relation be defined in the same way <em>mere words </em>are defined? Can this relation be captured in the approaches of "the philosophers"?

Analyzing "use" is a generic procedure, where under that we find derivative procedures akin to "linguistic analysis," linguistics, philology, etiology (in the scientific sense), sociology, etc. Morphemes, phonemes, "surface grammar," etc correspond to "use." And "meaning" is that which stands above, below, behind or whatever the "use"; perhaps it is identical to use! On popular interpretations, however (say, Millianism), "meaning" just is the object; other interpretations involve meanings being defined in terms locality with respect to the skull, neural distribution events within a brain map, "volitions" or "cognitions," embodied thoughts, senses, "Ideas," etc.

However, Wittgenstein was chiefly concerned not with things that fall under "use" or "meaning," "syntax" or "semantics" but with the <em>criteria </em>by which relationships between the two are formed, governed; the criteria which established "laws" and "grammar." Wittgenstein was not concerned with the old dichotomies of "realism" and "idealism," but with a third category that, I believe, is not only irreducible to these concepts but, moreover, whose existence grounds the impossibility of reducing them to each other.

Thus, the "civil status" of things turn on criteria. Primarily, why we assume identity, reducibility, causality, duty, morality, structure and so on <em>as relations</em> which <em>hold</em>, <em>bear relevancy</em>, or <em>exist </em>in the first place. <em>These concepts </em>are shaped by not only the things which fall under "old dichotomies": mind/brain, idealism/realism, soul/body, universal/particular, etc., but also by the metaphors, idioms, conceptual schemes, circumstances and so on which engender and produce criteria by which such concepts emerge and are applied.

Say, criteria stand to identity just as the physical stands to the human brain. The laws of the brain supervene on the laws of the physical (natural laws); the "laws" of identity supervene on the laws which govern criteria (the logical structure of the criterion, rules for the applicability of concepts).

"Use" may be seen as "externalized" (the physical, the linguistic, markings, utterances, effects, etc). We may quantify it, describe it, measure it. "Meaning" may be all together obscure, abstract, spiritual, intangible, etc.; it is "internal," say. To say "meaning <em>is </em>use in language" is to identify a third party: <em>in language, </em>wherein criteria are more or less manifest. <em>Laws </em>pervade language; but surface grammar and "logical" grammar identify <em>interpretive approaches </em>to disparate domains: the domain of meaning and the domain of use. However, the third domain is not on the same "level" or categorical position within this metaphysic: and nor are the other domains identical to or reducible to it. There is no "metaphor-in" or analogy <em>into </em>this domain, as it makes "identity," "complexity," "causality," "surface laws" (natural laws), their <em>sensicality.</em> This domain does not consist of <em>objects for measurement, </em>since "objects for measurement" is a concept that has sense in virtue of this domains existence. Might we say there is a recursivity that defines, in part, the nature of such a domain? It is not quite clear that "is recursive"]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine applied to Google for a contracting gig. He faced a JavaScript question to the effect: "Provide a wrapper function which passes an arbitrary number of arguments to the openDiaglog window method. (You cannot use an array.)"
</p><h2><code>call</code></h2><p>
<code> (function() {
// passing n-number of arguments through a wrapper function

}("openDialog-wrapper-function.html", "Google Search", "window.open features", "arg1", "arg2", 41263));
</code></p>
<blockquote>apply is very similar to call, except for the type of arguments it supports. You can use an arguments array instead of a named set of parameters. With apply, you can use an array literal, for example, fun.apply(this, [name, value]), or an Array object, for example, fun.apply(this, new Array(name, value)).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"The spectacle thus reunites the separated, but it  reunites them only in their separateness.
<div>—G.B.</div></blockquote>
[L]anguage engenders and enshrines the appearance of <em>manifest </em>unification.  Let us explore this assertion, for it is composed from myriad phenomena and their observation. By engendering, or the bringing about of, the appearance of manifest unification we mean to identify the systematic confluence of like linguistic objects. At varying levels of linguistic categorization, we may observe common traits of words, phrases and statements. Often, in linguistic and philosophical circles, we denote two self-evident levels at which commonality may occur by invoking <em>the superficial grammar of language</em>, which is described by dictionaries and the like; and on the other front, we assume that which the "language philosophers" of the early-to-mid 20th century assumed: that there exists a "logic" to language which is not apparent by its superficial schematization.

By "superficial," we mean not to demean, undermine or underestimate the import and significance of any advance past or present in the philological or lexical sciences (the linguistic sciences). We mean merely to acknowledge the objective quality of languages itself; namely, that languages possess an empirical form which may be subject to the governing laws of nature and the probabilistic psychophysical relations which hold between signs and perceivers and users of those signs. In the way that one may observe the empirical properties of a caution sign, one may observe the empirical properties of the letterforms or glyphs by which the caution sign transmits its message. These concrete properties may be analyzable as such, and in the way that the contours of the sign itself may be studied, as a geometric approximation, as a object subject to the physical laws; i.e., gravity, etc.

So then, with the logical form of language, we may observe laws not essentially physical, such that the laws discovered may not answer to, or be reducible to, the physical laws. To underscore the distinction, we admit the pyschophysical relation specifically identified as our acquisition of language. Language, admittedly, must be learned through experience; and under a scientific viewpoint, by the encountering of or the stimulus of graphemes and phonemes in their actualized mode of presentation (i.e., concrete sentences expressed in texts or through speeches). We assume that there are pyschophysical laws governing the acquisition of language and the effects which actualized language has on the neural structures of the brain. These laws are in category fundamentally different from the laws of reason, or the laws by which like entities are identified as such. We mean, then, to identify sentences such as

The unicorn carried them beyond the horizon.

Whatever a unicorn amounts to must be described by a language of some sort, and it may be said to exist in virtue of its accordance with reality or its accordance with logical properties which any thing bears.

Its practitioners participate in, or even facilitate, the  constant alignment of signs; with such a force, when with superficial  grave empathy, such that the signified becomes obfuscated. But even  more, we may say that the signified becomes obscured in its total  reality. From the indetermination of the unassailable signified, the  sign prevails as the dominate object of the thought. We may say, the  object which must be thought. Down to the most granular, the object  which must be thought must be thought in sole virtue of the possibility  of its presence. So, say, the trip of an emotional rift between persons:  that which is signified is the opposition between persons, but the  description of such an event befuddles the observer and the player. The  opposition is the object which must be thought, for its desire is to be  the precipitate to its own resolve:]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Language in isolation; Our Philosophers on Holiday</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We read the contemporary philosophers, those subtle charlatans unbeknown to even themselves as they wax sober on the radicalism and dogmatism of our technological age. Recorded the Greek historian Thucydides, echoing a still-truth which is today obscured by Our Philosophers rankly cool and "analytic" tone --
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"ability  to understand a question from all sides meant that one was totally unfitted for action"</p>
-- the imagination of the philosophers and discursive procedures of their trade enable them to squirm and grope through the bloodied topics <em>as if </em>on a battlefield of their own. The demand for clarity becomes no less different from the imperative to slay one's opponent on the peace-torn skirmish-grounds.

And so what am I getting at here? Well, I aim to say something about language, as per usual. But the essential question is, as always: how is philosophy possible? How is it possible for an author to engender such a queer kind of dialogue with himself and his Self? (The Self as an impetus to enquiry and the self as that which is the coagulation of the historical entity -- a collection of events, acquisitions of knowledge, facts, dispositions, moods, persona, etc.? -- The historical self and the essential Self, that which does not "follow" from one's being-as-past, but that which is autonomous being-as-such.)

Something aloof is that which guides such a misanthropic tendency to behave intellectually as one "ought." Disinterested and disenchanted truth is the aim of the philosophers, and presumably it has a structure: indeed, it is language -- or Language -- who bears the tainted marked, the markings as structure, as structured, as the structure, <em>on which </em>thought is manifest.

Stability in the world of Senses, Propositions, Concepts, transfer into the world of Language, our World. What might I mean by "stability"? The God of Isaac and Job and Moses and of itself is such a being-quaint-being, familiar and stable in culture, through or by virtue of the trails and trajectories of history, empires have carried it into our everyday, and perhaps into the every-other-day of our children. Nevertheless, it persists: it is a persistent concept, insistent even, demanding, commanding, reputable-without-why.

Acknowledging these facts, Our Philosophers touch on the topic as if the persistence of the concept in our culture's mind, as it were, similarly holds in our language. So They find Statements and Sentences representative -- candidates -- of the Party -- how pitiable is it, that! the representative-democritique. Whatever <em>that </em>means.

Find that which has been asserted, and writhe, wail and wax woefully in that sober and sobering analysis -- but let us <em>entertain </em>ourselves with what is assertable! We may describe <em>even the fauna </em>as having made this or that assertion, with our jolly and loopy mess of analogical hubris; even World equal, and thus even World bears an agent of some form or other. But what does it mean to be assertable!

Similarly any argument may look <em>justified </em>if we switch and sham the context under which adequate justification is possible; and it is no difficult matter to imagine <em>the justified </em>here for them or there for us. But <em>justifiability </em>is a more intangible tramp, in which the discernment of context itself becomes the question. <em>For the Nazi's</em>, of course, <em>that would count as an adequate justification </em>(under the premises or foundation of their system); but let us address the question: Why do we find it insincere to describe theirs <em>as a system at all? </em>

<em>Assertability carries the same conceptual mark;</em> let us not entertainment dryly what is similar between human behavior and animal behavior on the grounds of what we <em>have done, </em>insofar as language careens into the picture, but insofar as what is warranted, justifiable, possible, allowable -- let us address the conditions for assertions, and let us expose the fact that <em>reasons </em>factor into those conditions, not mere causal-law childplay and collision of inert materials. The causal conditions are not the only conditions at play when we speak of what is assertable. Moreover, let us investigate the <em>role </em>our assertions play in our lives, for such a concept -- the role -- partly constitutes the meaning of what we say; thus, to reiterate: to not attack the proposition, or its expression in language, <em>as if </em>it could be isolated.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Definitions</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Millianism (M)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The meaning of a name is exhaustively accounted for by its referent; additional semantic features which we commonly attach to the name are not constitutive of its meaning.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Principle of Translation (PT)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If a proposition, p, expresses a truth in language, L, then p similarly expresses a truth in any language into which it is translated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Disquotational Principle (DP)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If a speaker, S, of language, L, utters or expresses proposition, p (of L), then S believes p, ceteris paribus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Hermeneutic Principle (HP)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If a name has a single referent, then it may be correctly represented in logic by a single constant.</p>
<em>Against Millianism</em>

Kripke, per the paper in question, wants us to believe that Millianism is safe in light of the following argument (B1-B3):
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A1. B is/has X;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A2. B and C are the same thing;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A3. Therefore, C is/has X. (Valid)</p>
Well, in that case,
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B1. S believes B is/has X;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B2. [And since] B and C are the same thing;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B3. Therefore, S believes C is/has X. (Invalid)</p>
A1-A3 is presented here to underscore a valid argument form, and, moreover, to expose the work DP plays. Generally, the point is that <em>belief contexts make the inferences <strong>like</strong> above invalid.</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Speaking to the practical relevance of this entire discussion, in any case where <em>we </em>are in a situation like the one in which we know propositions like B1 and B2, we are blocked from making the inference, B3, or any similar inference.</p>
The point behind indenting the above statement is to highlight my attempt to break a kind of fourth wall which exists between author, myself, and reader, you. Kripke's "puzzle" isn't about you in any personal way; it is about the inferences human beings make implicitly, in virtue of basic assumptions about language and belief. [Edit]

Kripke's puzzle, in a way, can be viewed in light of Humean skepticism. Of course, S has <em>some belief or other </em>about B/C, and we should be able to come down to an answer as to whether S believes that B/C has or does not have, is or is not, X. A belief on the matter is there; we are not flirting with grotesque nihilisms or arch-skepticisms; partly, the central problem here is <em>how one might explain rational behavior in light of such a logically invalid inference. </em>Moreover, it is presumed by the author, that such an inference is one everyone systematically makes daily; or let's just say <em>exceptionally frequently. </em>And of course, no one is going to doubt that the average Joe on the street may be tragically misinformed on the finer points of atonality in music theory or the most recent astronomical discoveries dripping from the pages of the most recent publication of Time; no one will doubt that the Everyperson is, on most conversational exchanges, effectively, and for universal lack of a better word, a dolt, or to say the least, isn't a PhD candidate.

Such statements as "Pierre believes London is pretty" and "Joe is my gardener" are logically similar, so representation of such statements is philosophically admissible. We hazard no remiss in replacing "Joe" with J and "Pierre" with P. That said, once we get to the logical nuts and bolts, my point comes more clearly: symbolize the statements (P believes Lp, etc) and imagine or recall an event in your life where B1-B3 holds. The point here is not to ask your whether you know, in a personal and intimate way, Pierre or P or S, but to take what you do know -- propositionally, perhaps -- and expose a similarity with B1-B3 in virtue of form. From where I see things, a radical skepticism should be engendered:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How many beliefs do we attribute to others, where our chain of reasoning is similar to B1-B3; that is, on the basis of invalid reasoning? (That is, where we say, knowingly or unknowingly, that so-and-so believes such-and-such.)</p>
Again, my thinking may be a bit murky here, but let me put it this way: Is there any substantial difference between "Pierre believes London is ugly" and the following list of statements:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pierre believes Karl is outside;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pierre believes Mr. Pickwick is in the elevator;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pierre believes Leela is on the soccer team;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pierre believes that Sam knows how to operate a forklift</p>
On the last one, then:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">C1. Pierre believes that Sam knows how to operate a forklift;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">C2. Sam and Steve are the same person;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">C3. Therefore, Pierre believes that Steve knows how to operate a forklift. (Invalid)</p>
So, one might argue: Pierre doesn't <em>have </em>to believe anything about anything, let alone about Steve. And this brings us to our central issue: Kripke wants us to believe that this form of invalid reasoning does not present a problem for Millianism alone. Presumably, after touching Kripke's paper and assuming some philosophical training, one may look at the above argument form with the opinion that such a form exposes a serious flaw in the definition Millianism puts on proper names.

<em>Of course</em>, says the Everyperson, <em>Pierre doesn't have to believe any one way or another about Steve! He doesn't know anyone named Steve! </em>Our response, then, is so much for Millianism. Names do not mean anything above and beyond their referents. But again, Kripke asks us to imagine the same argument form where Millianism is not put forth for discussion: generate the argument form from TP and DP. Now try developing it from DP alone. Try developing it without M, TP or DP. On this latter attempt, one might look to HP for guidance.

But let us expose the problem in a different way.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D1. John believes that Susan is a stripper.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D2. John believes that Caroline is not a stripper.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D3. Susan and Caroline are the same person.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">D4. John believes D1 and D2, where S = C.</p>
Whereas in the previous Sam/Steve-example, we can provide a simple reply: Pierre doesn't know Steve. But in this example, substitution <em>salva veritate</em> gets us into trouble. Granted, in the previous example something is still amiss: Given M and P-Logic, Pierre <em>should </em>believe that Steve knows how to drive a forklift. Saying, "Well, he just doesn't know Steve" is a kind of hand-waving which might irritate even Moore, I think, for such a response simply fails to consider basic concepts of validity, definition, etc. Such a response is just too simple-minded, for it furthermore fails to address the issue: Why does rationality (P-Logic, etc) get us into this predicament? And if <em>this </em>is what rationality gets us, how do we ever get through the day-to-day? I see a strong practical dilemma here; namely, how do we even begin to talk about engaging the world, through (language and) reasoning, in a practical way. We certainly <em>do </em>get through the day-to-day, but it seems that we cannot have any rational basis for defending <em>why </em>we do. This is an echo from Hume and skeptics of that ilk. If we do progress daily in a rational way, then, we might demand that to <em>say </em>that we do, we must explain <em>why </em>we do, lest accept that "rationality" means, strictly speaking, nothing at all. (So much for Christians and Republicans being "psychopaths," etc. -- so much for the cool, apathetic criticism of postmodernites who can "pardon" stupidities of Biblethumpers and Loveless Scientists, for "pardoning" in this way is justifiable only in terms of an established "baseline rationality," one for which we are at a loss, given a little legwork from the fundamental conceptual machinery previously provided from the argument form.)

Assuming Kripke is correct on the matter, on generating the paradox without M and with DP and PT,  in order to save us from invalid inference, we must drop either DP or PT. That is, to prevent the argument from even getting off the ground, we would have to drop garden variety assumptions we intuitively make daily. So, if one drops PT, one would be committed to the line of thought, possibly, that (1) different languages have different truths, (2) propositions are not expressed by statements, etc, etc.

Quite clearly (1) is an unacceptable principle to be committed to, especially if one considers the milktoast variety of statements to which we are focused. (2) may lead one to arguably acceptable position that propositions to do not exist, or that they do exist but that statements are not the right kinds of things which pick them out. Moreover, the entire commitment puts one in a place of having to account for a possible self-counterintuitive notion of truth, what can be its bearers (what can be true or false), etc. But, as mentioned earlier, the argument form can be generated without PT; but the question then remains whether there exists a class of problems from which PT is necessary for that class's construction.

Kripke suggests, if I recall correctly, that the argument form may be generated by DP alone, bearing in mind the feature of homophony in language. In his Paderewski-experiment,

E1. S believes that Paderewski is X.

E2. S does not believe that Paderewski is X.

E3. E1 &amp; E2

In this case, the name "Paderewski" was picked up by S in two different contexts, but each name picks out the same individual, where S is unaware. Say that, for E1, S overheard that "Paderewski is X" on the radio, and for E2, S's sister informs her that Paderewski is not X. Being credulous so far as radio and her sister goes, she absorbs and forms mutually excluding beliefs about "Paderewski." They're both, the radio and her sister, talking about the same person, but for whatever reason S hasn't made the connection. Perhaps S forms the belief found in E2 through her own introspection while driving home, given the talk with her sister, but fails to modify the belief in E1 because she, S, cannot believe that her sister would know anyone actively working in radio or associated with radio, let alone Paderewski. But this is going to far: Why should S believe that the same person is being referred to in virtue of having the same name? Generalizing and factoring such an assumption into the definition of names, or proper names, first goes against intuition and habit: do we systematically, or merely frequently, take in names and check whether they refer to the same individuals, places, things, etc? Second, the affirmative to such a question would commit one to the queer metaphysical notion that names <em>contain those entities picked out. </em>The difference is that the former point requires a peculiar assumption about human habit, and the latter requires outright nonsense: in what sense do names <em>contain the entities themselves for us to judge new name bearers? </em>The name itself doesn't <em>tell </em>who its bearer is; its meaning <em>is </em>its referent; its meaning (referent) isn't told to you by its syntax. But this is all assuming a veracity given to Millianism.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A feature of a name: such that the thing to which it is a potential name can have meaning. A name tracks, or springs into existence (semantic baptism). But we might use the thing in various social practices despite its lack of a name. A theory, a tool, a digital device, etc. One might refer, successfully, to the object or thing, communicating an intention, etc. Must we possess a language(0) in order to understand the semantic significance of any mundane object, or thing, which rests beneath, or perhaps founds, our natural language, language(1)? In language(1), the potential name is actualized: "hammer". But if this term does not exist in language(0) for speaker, S, then we have a question as to the relationship between language(0, S, t) and language(1, S, t).

We may call language(0, S, t) the pre-linguistic. Rational human behavior persists under this frame; certain names for objects, at various points of manifest rational activity, do not exist. Given this, the object/term relation does not exist for any given speaker. One question is what rationality amounts to if an assumption is made such that only object/term relations can count as evidence toward a determination of an event within the cognitive system of any given speaker. (Vague; edit.) Moreover, (assuming) a name is never given through ostensive definition, how can we reliably track the rates at which names are introduced to human agents? Whether the rates are astronomical in acquisition is irrelevant: we are concerned with the tracking of principles of naming. We aim to understand the rates of introduced principles which may be spread across years and a multitude of experience. These would be tractable.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A cursory comment on HTML5 today</title>

HTML5 has two names. One for what it's doing in relation to the open source movement, and the other for its specification.

The spec is just a bunch of semantics. The former is about the shit that is mistaken for being part of the spec. (<a href="http://blog.codinginparadise.org/2010/06/html5-defined-its-not-just-marketing.html">http://blog.codinginparadise.org/2010/06/html5-defined-its-not-just-marketing.html</a>)

HTML5 has kicked Flash out of the mobile market. Some think that's only the first consequence of Apple's push against Flash, on the one hand, and the shit storm that is the non-iPhone mobile device market.

Apple's operating revenue is nearly equal to the top four mobile device providers. When they say "change the channel" people listen.

It's not really HTML5 that's going to "wow" people. Or rather, if it is, it'll be acknowledged analogously to how most people today acknowledge apache. HTML5 itself doesn't mean much to most people. It's all the fancy gaming stuff that will get dropped on top of that platform of semantics. And all that is JavaScript and CSS. These two have their own set of specs and APIs to hash out.

Web Workers, WebStorage and WebSockets are all coming all nicely. When those hit Recommendation Status, <em>that</em> is when you'll see the Internet taken over by the Web.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm sure many of you developers feel overwhelmed. By other, more esteemed developers, you're being told to get back to work. In the django forums, for the language's development, the core developers are kicking #sopa noise out.

I just started learning assembly, and I don't have time for this shit. But now, as I browse sites like kippt or what have you, I'm encountering "stop censorship" JavaScript overlays. Sudden protests. Hell, my personal site has one up. Imagine if protestors were to march through your shoppes? Through your playgrounds. Through your streets? They're doing this on the Web and by #occupy. Shats like this <a href="http://steveblank.com/2012/01/04/why-the-movie-industry-cant-innovate-and-the-result-is-sopa/">bloke</a> are trying to device conceptual structures to enable the respective offended industries. While developers are demanding that Google or somebody with some steam take a stand. More blight on the Web. I don't want relics and snapshots of this war-state littered in my fucking inbox, in my browser. I don't want to install Tor. I don't want to take the effort to browse securely. I don't want to type my password in more quickly because you're standing over my shoulder. I want no passwords, no certificates. "Go the fuck away with the fear-mongering" I want to say. And everyone thinks -- I use this term loosely -- it's all unrelated.

#occupy is protesting in the street. They're sacrificing themselves through show of bravado to gain media and tactical advantage. #anonymous has published video propaganda. And some hackers have publicly discussed targeting Senators, efforts to destroy their careers.

The issue is not that the legislation <em>will</em> pass. (Fuck predictions.) The issue is that the context in which the legislation will be discussed and voted on. The context is Marshall Law (NDAA). Do you understand how spiritually troubling this is? To know that your country declared Marshall Law AFTER the vote on #sopa and #pipa were PUSHED BACK?

I give. I firmly believe in a couple of months, this country will exist as a Stalinist state. And I'm not going to do anything about it. I need to get back to work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now that I think about it, Google is the reason I've found happiness. Well, not the Happiness you're thinking of. I usually try to avoid big concepts. I ask the wrong questions because I assume nothing is too big to fall. I s'pose I have trained my mind to enjoy what is common and what can be exposed easily. This, indeed, makes <em>search</em> easier.

I enjoy it here, deep within the Shallows. The mind may find many things unto eternity if one keeps pace resilient and syntax familiar.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My plan was to be the fastest. Before high school, my plan was to be the fastest person on this earth. I wanted to break a world record. I wanted to do this because I thought I had HIV/AIDS. Even today, the GOP wages a war on women, half shrouded by fantastical lies and essential hatred, misogyny. I agree with Gil Scott Heron, the revolution will not be televised. The media: FOX, CNN, MSNBC, etc., function based on how well they can filter lies, but not only this: filter lies along a narrative, a story, this political economy consumes daily, habitually. I count the sirens along the streets. And I wonder if cops howling behind me would simply put on their signals and get over. I cannot tell whose chasing who, or if it's all a ruse to establish a baseline anxiety about my country. McCain would have this. Fear is essential to belief; one cannot have belief without fear, as it were. But: "Simplicity is <em>essential </em>to brilliance". The man, Mr. Bruce Lee, isn't even from this nation-state. He too was alienated from the start: the idea that the Home structures at all.

I was born in a ghetto. I lived at Gun's Point for a spell. This was supposed to have been my Home. And that it structures me completely. Of course, I don't buy it. I am what I am. It is an interesting thought that I have come to, a transcendence, if you will.
<blockquote>Where I am, there you will find Africa.</blockquote>
My story will be told. It will last. And I will burn this country to the ground, federal building by federal building if I have to. I will blow up your house. I have seen my people culturally raped by this country. I have been convinced not to see them. And even now I today carry a mark of the Black Sheep. (If you're wondering, Black Sheep are the Black Americans in my sci-fi novel; they are a race different from the Earthshakers, who are the Indo-Europeans. And I am a clever virus.) The television gave me the power not to see my people, and I have seen nothing but thuggery, gangsterism, self-violence, other-violence, racial hate crime perpetrated against the same race, sexual experimentation with our race, and essential hatred. Even today homeless men pick fights with me in the street, instead of bowing out painfully as they usually do; and yet I can cast spells with the computer system. For all intents and purposes I am a sorcerer, a master of information, a master of the machine.

And yet I live in a society that marks me. For my hair preference. In a society where anyone wears and looks like whatever he or she wishes, I am marked. What guidance does "cut your hair bring" other than that one should <em>obey</em>. Again:
<blockquote>Where I am, there you will find Africa.</blockquote>
Had you once thought that I might be the coming of the end? Try me. <em>Try me. </em>

I will not allow the television that it should make corruption out of me. <em>I am a virus. I am the virus.</em>

Once I realized the television spoke lies, being the feebly intellect I was at 13 or so, I woke up, as tritely as it can be put. The cost was that I had developed a means to establish my name, a name as the Author of Pentateuch lists. As Marcus Aurelius lists. My goal was to set a world record, as the fastest, and have my story be told. And bow out painfully, as the immune system weakens. I was 9, or 10, with little guidance, except for some brutally antagonistic boyfriend or two. Even today I have to make up the story of why I have a gash demonstrated across my left hand. First world problems, indeed; not quick enough to swallow the salt of life, not able to consume the rugged individuality ethos-schmethos. Indeed, <em>I will blow up your house.</em>

And so I played. I lived a life of death. A life of a kind of death row. Call me melodramatic -- and I will beat the living shit out of your ass (I learned how to say that from an electro-punk band). -- <em>I am Africa.</em>

Need it be said again? Doubtless, to be sure. And so I lived with the realization that I should live. That I will live, but with years of grief. A childhood of carelessness suddenly lost, as yet its memories linger. I found happiness in never touching, never loving, never sharing, never sipping after another, staring for too long, making eye contact, lying, self-reflection, reflection on G-d, warming self mental stimulation. For years I cultivated the most vile talent: the potential to think. My body has the behaviors of a thinker, and standardized tests in this country have for years systematically disenfranchised and plundered enumerable African-descent peoples. And now I am here, seeing this. Reading this. Understanding this. I see your Civil Rights, and now I still see nothing.

Except myself. Doubly I have lived in a country that seeks to erase my history, and I have lived with a folly of mind that enables me to see the erase of my own. I might one day pick memories at will and modify them, reduce them, resize them, extend or share them in ways never thought before.

I had to give up my goal of <em>the fastest</em>. I now aspire to be <em>the blackest. </em>As a virus, I aspire to end all things, your music, your rock and roll, your rap, your television, your car, paper, pens, checkbooks, convenience stores, weaponry, standing forces, railways, office buildings, your bank, your government, demagoguery, lying lobbyists who lie, scandal, bigotry, religion, hatred and lies. And even more.

Everyone realizes their own limits, given this or that. I realized that I had no natural talent for great speed using my legs. No metaphysical surprise, quite. But left with little option, what was I to do with college? Religion? Politics? Business? With studies? With books? I <em>wanted to be the fastest. -- Boring.</em>

And then I'm told my heart just won't take <em>the run</em>. What to you want from me? What seriously the fuck more do you want from me? I lived no real childhood. And then even <em>the run </em>is fucking taken from me? <em>What the fuck do you want from me? </em>

Coach Z plucked me from the baseball team because of my stride alone. And then I'm to find out that cardiac arrest should be my concern on top of winning a race? <em>What the fuck do you want from me? </em>I spent years wondering, quite truly, why the fuck I was reading whatever I was reading, and not running, <em>the run. </em>

<em>Twice. </em>Was I fooled by something some legitimate source told me. People from <em>your world, of politics, and lies, and stupidity, and failure, and material things. </em>First by the television, and then by a peanut gallery of doctors and cardiologists. <em>Advisable</em> that I not run. Who am I to debate a<em>doctor's test</em>? What does it even mean? How do I integrate such a prognosis into my life? And what the fuck else could Coach Z do except kick me off the team?

<em>Twice, </em>I say -- <em>Just run. Just try it. </em>Is this sound advice? Does a teenager adopt it? Alone, in a closest? Can you tell? Running, wanting to be the fastest, putting my name to the idea, for a time as my only reason for existence... Running was what brought me joy. Had you ever considered it? -- For years, I was robbed of the only thing that could give me joy.

<em>Twice, </em>I say -- <em>Just run.</em> <em>Doesn't hurt to ask (try). </em>This was Hawkman's advice, on just about everything. I reasoned that surely be might say the same about this matter. <em>Yeah, why not? Run. </em>I recall his machoism and anecdotes of reckless antics, I recall him severing a finger while managing some other feat. Surely, <em>just run.</em>

Months back I ran 4-5 miles, with some acquaintances. I took a heavy drag of my cigarette and stretched in Spider's fashion before we took off. I kept pace. My heart felt as if it were going to explode. Even today I feel the horrifying heartpangs at random intervals. But I ran more. I made it regular. And this Brittany was <em>bestially</em> murdered.

<em>What more do you want from me? What the fuck else do you want from me? </em>Am I existentially whining? Yes. Just whining? Yes. Will I blow up your house if you stand aback?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Perchance it simply need be said. One might think it more inflammatory to assert, "Every Thing is Copyrightable!" But given to the brand of philosophy in which I have received training, perchance it must be restated. Or rather, I am in search of the <em>mood </em>in which one must be in order to perceive its truth. One characteristic maneuvre of Descriptivists is such that,

X

becomes

non-X

That is to say, a phenomenon of one sort is actually not of the sort that it is perceived. Language may mislead, and so one's perception must obey the stricture needed for language. <em>We think into language, not in language. </em>The positivists of the 20th century have secured this <em>position </em>in their logical grammars: <em>this </em>becomes <em>something else. Not </em>a proposition, but <em>this. </em>For the proposition is what is asserted, which can be true or false. But <em>this </em>becomes <em>something else. </em>One claim from all of this might be: <em>What forms of cognition follow from anything that does not map to the grammar of a proposition? </em>If someone fails to have your accent, that person must be <em>different. </em>

<em></em>We have gone so far as to logically demonstrate this ethical principle: <em>trust not your perceptions</em>. Russellians et al. engage in this practice wilfully while abstaining from credence to Descartes. All to his import is nothing more than the reject of beliefs as a source of knowledge, and to this day, such a tradition persists. We fear that the phrase <em>The president of the United States </em>may be misleading, and we suggest this with stigma of paradox or sophistry. As more, a Tweet may be misleading. Every form of communication must be wholly constituted and situated through the means of a logical empire that set out to avoid <em>misleading </em>expressions. Today, all expression may be broken down into bits, emerging from the maturation of the logical empire.

Indeed, every expression is a sequence of events: servers, routers, people, etc. We call this, a "world." Today, one noteworthy point that motivates governments is: <em>The evolutionary cost of supervention. </em>Naturally, we might look at the concepts of pluralism or even monism. <em>What explains the Internet's supervenience on our world? </em>

The rules for survival are different if the grouping of events need not involve matter. "Grouping of events" involves a very different kind of reference when we talk of activity within the domain of the Internet. Every event is a specification for its own continuation.

In order to <em>argue</em> that <em>this </em>post is my own, I must copyright it.

<em>This </em>post does not mean X in a legal system.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many a time have I been told to "see a shrink" or "take a pill." One of my friends, after having treatment with "pills" <em>now </em>enjoys his sweetly-oriented bachelorhood while abstaining from talk of philosophy with women. He <em>now </em>often qualifies his statements to me with "it's not too technical -- so you should look into it." (He and I took mathematical logic (Logic III) together. However, early in our "friendship" he would assume that because I <em>disagreed </em>with him that I didn't <em>understand </em>some point he attempted to establish. He never thought that his thought experiment was simply poorly constructed or poorly expressed, or simply incoherent in itself.) He thinks talking philosophy "scares women off." He's an analytic philosopher.

I for one am fucking bored with Americans. And Americans are are caught up in the Sex-Class Boat (a play on Sex-Criminal-Boat).

I am going to fucking slap someone. I did not devote myself to my mental career, my career as a thinker, only to find myself with a fucking bullet in my head because of pissant wank American bullshit like this. Fuck you, and fuck  your fucking pills. <em>Talk </em>to your friends. <em>Listen </em>to them. <em>Understand.</em>

I was <em>put in jail. I </em>was put in jail. Am I "crazy" or do I "need pills" because I am upset by such an event in my life? This "friend" was aware of this event in my life. And the murder of my ex-girlfriend. This things upset me deeply. His response? "Take pills." Why? "When I was in a bad spot, they helped me out."

<em>1. You don't know what you are talking about.
2. You are not learned on the subject of psychology.
</em>3. <em>YOU. Whoever you are, PHD or not, shut the fuck up. </em>(<em>Stop talking Freud. Stop talking Jung. Stop making up fashionable jargon. Shut the fuck up.</em>)

Another person tells me to "take a pill," I will fucking kick them in the fucking throat. I am not fucking with you. This is beyond upsetting. (Fine, anecdotal evidence of this sort shouldn't be a point of departure for generalization.)
<h2>Fine</h2>
<blockquote>Anti-authoritarians question whether an authority is a legitimate one before taking that authority seriously. Evaluating the legitimacy of authorities includes assessing whether or not authorities actually know what they are talking about, are honest, and care about those people who are respecting their authority. And when anti-authoritarians assess an authority to be illegitimate, they challenge and resist that authority—sometimes aggressively and sometimes passive-aggressively, sometimes wisely and sometimes not.

My point is this: Americans are fucking lazy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>0. Opening</h2>
I am Repeatable. But first let me explain myself. Sarah asked the other day, "So why won't my boyfriend talk with me about dildos?"; or another friend lamented to me, "I don't want to just bike to point B, I want to bike to point X." And in case you're wondering, everybody realizes they need <em>junk control. </em>The obvious point from all of this is that <em>political theatre </em>is a repeatable function of social systems. The fact that Schwarzenegger picked up the heavy thing, and was a governor because of it. Barack Obama is the first black President of the United States. Rick Perry; Newt Gingrich; Alain Badiou; Tina Fey; Bob Dylan; Tupac; Richard Dawkins; Richard Feynman; Iris Murdoch; Sarah Palin; Saul Kripke; Alvin Plantinga; Quentin Smith. For decades now we have dealt thought experiments involving hot pokers which produce <em>unexpected reports </em>on sensation, experience machines, Turing Tests et al., artificial sweeteners, the entire facade of the Western Diet over morality, etc. Yet I s'pose you're wondering: <em>Has </em>he <em>done it before?</em> A child exits his front door, each day, to find only empty parking lots with drafted mirages delimiting every pathway. It is an Earth unpeopled, cities of silence, which lay before him, lacking any temerity save for the rustling of leaves. What here is repeatable? <em>Is Raphael repeatable? </em>A graph might suggest. Or perhaps the license plate game does tell. What occurs when the <em>obscure </em>discover their own repetition? Camus, I believe, dealt us a similar obstacle: <em>suicide </em>is the only interesting philosophical problem. <em>Who </em>might perceive the absurd that <em>is </em>repeatable? What might the shape of her justification be? Moreover, why <em>any </em>street corner? Why must any <em>where </em>factor in? What consideration of the causal machinery at play truly shapes the mode of justification of suicide? We might suggest that the full decontextualization of Camus' "absurd man" is our culprit: that is, it is not <em>absurd </em>human, but rather the <em>absurdity of </em>humanity; like <em>the stove of the kettle.</em> Justification takes the shape of context, but Camus exposes for us the <em>shape of justification </em>of another form: we are led to see "man" remove himself from context as though causally free. What <em>is </em>repeatable is <em>one, </em>the person, but what is not is the action: the action is <em>free</em>, thus unrepeatable. One is free to follow the absurd regardless of one's context. Perhaps we should say: <em>obey the demands </em>of the absurd. -- I, however, am Repeatable. Perhaps this, then, is our paradox.
<h2>1. "I Am An Unrelated Atom" (I prefer to do things with others rather than on my own.)</h2>
Jake is an avid chess player, perhaps even a hustler. His turf covers from about <em>here</em> to <em>there, </em>but he's wary of open files anyway. He's fairly aggressive about his knights, one might <em>say</em>. -- Here one might be reminded of paradoxical linguistic traps; e.g., <em>this </em>sentence is unprovable but true; the books of the Bishop (Peter Abelard) <em>What </em>makes a human being social? Is it the vagueness of one's own limits? <em>Should </em>language be imprecise, then how ever might one come to delineate <em>what-is-mine</em> from all the rest?
<h2>2. "We Have the Tools to Stop This Machine" (I prefer to do things the same way over and over again.)</h2>
In the face of automation, why should anyone wish to become a programmer? If the computer can do it, why would I ever wish to? To this we might suggest the <em>inherent creativity </em>of programming: the <em>choice </em>of repetition.
<h2>3. "Russellian Teapots" (If I try to imagine something, I find it very easy to create a picture in my mind.)</h2>
Obviously any <em>celestial</em> teapot <em>is mind-independent. Regardez le mot, repetez-vous! </em>
<h2>4. "Paul Jennings, We Have a Problem" (I frequently get so strongly absorbed in one thing that I lose sight of other things.)</h2>
Objects, too, are repeatable. Paul Jennings realizes this: objects, things, too obey the laws of evolution. Why should this be so? Does it even make sense? What does it mean to su --- Prediction of Voice -- Not a 21st cen phil --- The emergence of Provenance (A Speaker of Tongues as Language); Empathy demands knowledge from the eyes of the Amoralist; the grace of sound in animals as one's body radiates music On Kripke book: 0, 1, ?; past, present, future; the necessity of logical structure; from present we cannot perceive the past; but not vice versa as for the future in statements Godel's Incompleteness as a predictor for suicide ethics; a discursive protoethics as a arithmetization of meta-ethical statements ("I am  not "livable" in this system" -- Fugues of Living Organic; a diet of deities' stories) Provenance rules out death; in principle 27. What if one groundhog hears something? In some previous story, we partook of the narrative. A narrative wherein one gains a hypersensitivity to objects. Indeed. There we have the form of a species. Some cannot hide their social defects, while others hide them perfectly. Our previous idea might be suggested thus: a Social Template Model exists at each planet. Sociality itself might be a factor of survivability, and if the context should be removed or nullified from the event of social interaction, a member of a species might record or become a measure for the point of departure. Hazarding an analogy, a dog's placement within a group might be triangulated by social types of a higher or lower order species. My speculation is that dogs maintain a kind of grace which records a form of harmony between species; perchance their hypersensitivity to certain sounds enables a kind of trait which might endure throughout the decay or demise of civilizations. We might not consider this a miracle, but a maximal set of conditions necessary and sufficient for survival across something greater than generations, often recorded in terms of geological timescale. Another consideration might be the scientific character of history itself, as history itself becomes a content applied to which a scientific character of history maintains a dominant role in the scientific character of history, most obviously, itself. The apologies for a digression is an indicator, surely. Aoson: A groundhog has been the butt of a number of grand joke. Bason:  Says the nihilist! How could you interrupt the rote? Aoson: Might I intercept the rhythm of a set? Bason: However your debt, there's never a bet! Aoson: _______________________________________]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Shroom Union (Draft: 3 of 3)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Object Economics (The Politics of Immanent Objects)</h2>
Nothing-to-Hide Arguments and Plato's Ring of Gyges are structurally similar. Notice that Gyges had everything to hide, being the King's confidant, even to <em>his Queen</em>, yet the Ring represents a pure multiplicity of different situations wherein all is exposed through the power of the Ring itself, such that if these things were hidden, the user of the Ring might become powerless. The Ring ruptures the situation by its sole indifference to it, it may remain chosen or not, yet its presence enables <em>indeterminate presentation</em>. What might proffer the power of the Ring? -- We commonly consider <em>who </em>might proffer the power of the Ring. Let us consider the <em>historicity</em>, the ontic history, of objects, such that any object might compel us.
<h2>The Phenomenology of Things (An Anticipation of Provenance): Agent, Object, Process</h2>
By consequence, nothing normative can be drawn from the simple realist examination of the becoming of things. In particular, the victory of the market economy over planned economies, and the progression of parliamentarism (which in fact is quite minor and often is achieved by violent and artificial means) do not constitute arguments in favor of one or the other.

It is the converse situation: to have everything to hide is to equate objects with power, and to lack all governance over these objects is to make the Ring pointless, uncompelling (and thus Socrate's polity vacuous). To have nothing to hide is to do the converse: that one's objects are one's power, and that to hide them is to conceal that power. Who would take the Ring of Gyges? -- Everyone, strictly speaking, who must possess a thing. I suggest that the Ring represents a basis of freedom in choosing that which should be hidden and that which should not.
<h2>The Shroomunion</h2>
Yeah, it's a band. And so is Bardo Pond. And the Spastic Mountain Choir. Perhaps I'm making this shit up, but these shrooms look like penises -- and I'm just fucking tripping out. All my limbs wobble and throbble and throttle! Every band sounds the worst, every ringing compounds, and hopelessly my ears tremble for more. I've felt the recurring echos of reverberations from years before, ghostly happenings in the most cadenced lots or garages painfully painted and sweatfully compounds, and hopelessly still. DMT rings and passing nectar dripping chipped pipes catalystically flippant and inspiring, we rolled over or I doled into another pauper bard bending his fingers against the wall of birds, and the domes of trees. I hate music, for this reason. --

I picture, or it shews me, a world where every third male co-habitates with a farm, or rather a Planned Ecosystem. Our present marriage laws must needs allow for the federal cost of what might be called <em>technohusbandry</em>, or, to those politically-inclined <em>ecohusbandry</em>. Many analogies to <em>planning for a child </em>and its descriptive model are transferrable to the narrative of <em>botanical husbandry, </em>or, more suitably rendered, <em>farming. </em>Our most immediate political disnarrative involves the conceptualization of the plant insofar as that field has been guided, by political interest, to obscure technology and technology it. Notice that most metaphor which we use to describe the conceptual relations of machines involves the presentation of automotive and industrial machines. Perhaps historically such a phenomenon is intuitively grasped, but as yet, the emergence of "web" (fauna, spiders) and "synapses" (flora, fungi) or "networks" comfortably adorns our scientific literature. Naturally, neuroscientific literature is similarly fashioned with a richness quotient for the plausibility of its claims -- not only must we describe the world, but it must be described <em>beautifully.</em>

So it must be convincing. A man <em>printed </em>a burrito the other day, <em>and what that does mean. </em>"And what that does mean." One person might be capable of organizing an entire mercantile context, rather than a <em>chain </em>or corporation. The <em>brand </em>of the individual is the basis for our comfortability quotient with a corporation, the emotive impetus to <em>make purchase </em>from within and from the outside of its immanent force through which its market economy is installed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I understand. Well, the repeatability thing for sure, but chiefly that the connexion of memories is exactly identical to the connexion of agents, processes, and events. However, memories may be implemented over digital or analogue systems. Within the set of descriptions which may imply the existence of mammals, like us, whose linguistic superpartners follow, memories properly encoded produce propositions that contradict. "Linguistic superpartners do not exist", etc. (Or something like that)^2 The idea here is the actual presentation of technology used as if organic phenotype. Certainly the actual fact must manifest itself so. However, the basic fear of technology is inconnexion with the form of its presentation through external modes. This is a difference through which a truth unfolds. Should truths exist, they would be indifferent to differences. This outlines a set of sentences non-pertinent to their survival. Do you see, it may be described as the flexability of language, and its expression through the reflexive human form, as the mode of its attribute involves a relation within the whole of Substance whose nature it is to exist by P7,  we must consider -- honestly? The nature of matter. I mean, even Spinoza was remarkably cavalier. And I, again, am a virus.
<h2>Agent, Process, Object</h2>
Imagine a material description of every agent, process, and object. This includes dinosaurs, sauropods, mammals, meteors, the roads in Kansas, the laws of gravity, your grandmother, my grandmother, every tweet made 37 hours ago, carbomb specs drafted in 1985, every war. These descriptions follow from structural similarity between these ontic categories. Memories are the connexion of relations which immanate from these descriptions, whose statements are expressed as superpartners.

An agent may analyze an object. Yet agents are involved in the instantiation of a world, to which hey are objects. History, thus, becomes a science, and at once not. As such, it is the prediction of linguistic forms, such that later auhors might authorize identical dates over a period or event. But as yet, historians are technologically limited within ecological environments. Here we see that agents both structure and destructure the world. Spinoza is right, in that excellence is rare. How might the historian record adjacent cultures? The history of language begins with agent, object, and process.
<h2>Content of Empty Categories</h2>
What is the material content of agent, process, or object?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Homeostatic Stratoconomies Ready for Spacetime Primetime, Bukowskian Women on Mars, 2023</h2>
<em>Shockrates!</em>

So you know those times when girls have to get up at the same time?
Do you really notice them? It reminds me of a sitcomical situation
where some boy is hung up on girls. Most people get hung up on anything.
And then something happens, it happens coincidentally, sometimes not.
And sometimes someone notices. Until the thought on the matter becomes
empty, limited, twisted by the length of time it takes to consider the
thought. It's before, now, left of something in some hemisphere, of
neuronic activity and the blasphemous synapsis. It's a warzone of warzones
all reducible to a set of descriptions never before recorded at the time
of its previous recording. Some record of a recording resounding completely and happenstancely, as any given member of the species records, which is its power. The species that survives has recorded a formula for its survival, yet this is the exact problematic of interplanetary survival. What does it take for something like us to survive? Why should we take on another planet at all? It might surely be a misallocation of resources, for one polity should endure the material conditions of their labor, all the same. We have observed time and time again the cycle of civilizations, and yet what does it mean to start a civilization? What conditions must hold? What technologies must there be in place. We have considered the Mayan Templates as they present themselves scientifically at 10,000 years before any known such form of architecture. And surely, what kind of language must exist such that the Internet may be permitted? Every bit of information, let us say, behaves as a qubit at some perspective, from some scale. What of genes?]]></content:encoded>

Africa is an economically interesting country <a title="At times I view these linguistic events as meta-data for a particular causal fabric, or blanket, if you will, which describes a wholly immanent system. Such a system, in Spinoza's terminology, are present'd as modes of attributes. An attribute, if I may put it so prettily, may be crix-crossed and mix-matched, implemented or _applied_ to modes. Consider a quantum mechanical distributed psychological profile analysis. That was said, indeed. But nevertheless, species, of a sport and sort shall eternally integrate. Attributes may be expressed, as it were, through mode, or system, using semiotic alchemy. Most obviously the origin of a technospecies may be doubly interesting to a civilization astronomically more advanced than our own, but as yet it seems that the invention of a thing collapses into the storm and stress of approximated reality.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>There is one other bit of unpleasantness common to many adults with AS. Many adults who have reached a modicum of independence and control over their own lives may have done so through periods of self-medication and substance abuse. In instances where they have been able to stabilize their support systems to include marriage and employment, the reasons for drug and alcohol abuse often fall away. Except for individuals coming from families with a genetic proclivity towards substance abuse, they are able to live their lives fairly clean and sober, sometimes to the point of becoming teetotalers and swearing off all medication as harmful and unnatural. It is important for the reader to remember that despite their past abuse of drugs or alcohol, they are Asperger Syndrome first and foremost, subject to all-or- nothing thinking.

<cite>-- Roger N. Meyer. "Asperger Syndrome Grows Up Recognizing AS Adults in Today's Challenging World".</cite></blockquote>
Boring -- fair. Had one been given the chance to meet me as a child, one would never expect that I should turn to drug-use or even alcoholism, or cigarettes. On a daily basis I would ridicule and attack my mother, as a child, for smoking, constantly warning her of the increase in risk of cancer, etc. I was precocious, surely, but more importantly <em>highly moralistic</em>, which manifests as "black and white" thinking.

Almost on a daily basis I find others "correcting" me, reminding me that I should not carry the distinctions I do carry. Often, as a 27 year old, I find high schoolers or younger 20-somethings launching into an <em>authoritative tone</em> with me, so as to guide me from my black and white thinking. Days ago, after missing my poetry reading, I had an acquaintance instruct me to check out a certain -- now obviously forgotten -- poet. What does one do with an acquaintance of such a sort? Daily this "black and white" thinking seems to protect me from a huge landscape of neurotypical behavior that honestly should not pass for human. There is language, conversation, as it were, but very little what I would call him. Often I am told that I talk "at" or "to" people, rather than "with," but this is not so clear to me.

At the same time, there are people who, after a rough night of drinking, swear off this or that. Am I exhibiting simply a natural response to excess and shame?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>
I'm Aharon Alexander, from Houston, Texas. I do freelance web development, largely having to deal with frontend systems. So that might involve anything ranging from information architecture to *nix administration to design and photography, and as an obligation, the development of those frontend systems (SASS, JS, HTML5). My academic background is in philosophy, and I use that along with my obsessive systemizing to bring viable information to communities. I can drink anyone under the table and demonstrate Cartesian Skepticism or why SCM is a good practice or why the ChemCam is a big deal.
<h2>What hardware do you use?</h2>
2009 Macbook Pro, with 4GB RAM

2TB WD

Personally built desktop on a military grade ASUS motherboard with AMD 6-core proc, 8GB RAM, an old once-amazing graphics card and about 5 hard drives, one SSD.
<h2>And what software?</h2>
Vim
<h2>What would be your dream setup?</h2>
Project Glass]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Intentional-Real Distinction, over Objects</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We hazard a contradiction when it is claimed: All intentional states, by their very nature, entail the existence of an object to which this state is directed; that is, all intentional states bear a property of directedness. This feature of intentional states grammatically requires an object of some sort so as to satisfy the semantic significance of intentional states; unless we give in to the notion that intentional states are wholly inscrutable w/r/t analysis. This is a form of methodological skepticism, I s'pose.

But where is the contradiction? Well, if we hold to the aforementioned assumption, we must ask ourselves: What is the status of the object, by which our directedness, or intentional states, make sense. To put it crudely, an intentional state is a schema which requires an object of some sort: But again, what kind of object must it be? For contradiction: All intentional states require real objects, existing in the world, to which the mental act logically corresponds. By logically I mean only that within the complex structure of the act itself, the object play a part, a conceptual part. There is a correspondance between complexes, insofar as their parts and those parts' logical behavior, and objects, of whatever metaphysical rank or status.

But must "real objects" enthrall us? Clearly if I think of a unicorn, our rule for intentional states is not palpable enough to compel us to taking its existence for granted. An intentional act does not guarantee the existence of its object: the object itself may be unfit; and this may deceive us from observing the flaw in our method to assessing its metaphysical status. An object, insofar as its logical behavior, may impose requirements on how it ought to be treated within a logico-discursive procedure.

Concretely: we arrive at a conclusion. S thinks of P, where P is a fiction. By our rule, P exists. However, there is another rule (which exposes the contradiction I speak of):]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Et al.,

http://designshack.co.uk/articles/css/15-tips-for-designing-terrific-tables

This is mostly a follow-up to a series of talks Germain and I had today. The gist of it is captured in the first statement of the above article. In a way,
s are for content authors, left to be given some (usually bland) "content area design default" that doesn't aim to raise eyebrows. But interactive/information-display UI pieces (product charts, interactive-tabular data tables, &amp;c) where the content author isn't permitted and where UI/UX/Dev have to really think and plan, this is where the
should be considered last. The problem is that
s immediately restrict what one can do within a UI. Data in
s usually originate from a database (table), but this doesn't mean it has to be presented, developed or marked up as a table on the front-end. I want to make clear, though, that I am not arguing the use of
<div>

s where it is obvious that a table is most apt; rather, I am speaking to the planning that goes on before even front-end development.

For instance, for me, calls to action count as non-tabular data. There's never a reason to sort them because they usually say the same thing. What would you say are some similar examples of "non-tabular" data that have, in your experiences, made it into a table? With this said, I'm thinking in terms of the components of a table and how those components fit into the overall UI piece. Another consideration might be: What if the tabular data has a kind of presentational aspect to it? What I mean here is with examples like Mozilla Lab's projects page: http://mozillalabs.com/projects/

By "presentational aspect" I mean something that perhaps is best defined in the negative: Data that could be wrapped in a table but which is not meant to be consumed "quickly." When we look at one of our peer's, say, a project manager's, Outlook schedule for the day, we are usually overwhelmed. Should

</div>
s expected to have "overwhelming" quantities of data as opposed to small quantities be styled the same way?

But to echo a few points made during our chat: tables are primarily used to satisfy the criteria of presenting information is a logically structured way. But the "primary" or essential feature of

s can, in many cases, be accomplished by using, with some design and development ingenuity,
<ul>
	<li>
<ol>s, <dl>s, or strategically situated
<div>s. These approaches do not necessarily undermine semantic, accessibility and usability goals, and in many cases afford flexibility, ease-of-development, manageability, and cross-browser compatibility (since we don't have to conform to the rigid structure of a</div>
</dl></ol>
</li>
s,</ul>
).

True enough,

tables should be used for tabular data;

but the converse is also true:

Non-tabular data should not be used in tables.

This is just as important, I feel, as the first statement. Moreover, they amount to saying the same thing. What this means to me is that if I notice non-tabular data in a wireframe I begin to wonder whether a table is the best fit for the task. It isn't all-or-none, but a graded interpretive approach. One rule of thumb I use is that if there is at least one column that isn't sortable because it "just wouldn't make any sense to sort it," then I start to re-interpret the whole UI piece in a different light (in terms of
<ul>s or <dl>s, etc).

Plus, I personally find it very rewarding to wrap up a project where I started out with humble tables in my wireframes and rolled out with a fancy UI piece that immediately prompts developers to View Source.

</dl></ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Silence. It was a queer sort of rule of his. Goes without saying, or so the joke goes. And naturally he could ramble a reputable length on it. Within it. Above it. Birth'd from it. Well, that <em>is </em>the trick, isn't it? The <em>space </em>between the lines. He, like few, was a Mechanist of Silence. Observant of what counts as <em>space</em>, one can analogize: clearing one's way through the conditions for <em>silence. </em>Rule. Space. Silence.

Most of us get by thinking rules are in themselves queer things. And we best serve ourselves in not bothering with them. Though, for those syntactically inclined, silence flows as readily in the imagination as the air permeates the room. Deprive us of silence: can the mind <em>breath </em>at all? For the mind: silence is a basic need for self-preservation. But as yet, what must be the <em>culprit</em>? Space and silence, let us s'pose, are one. From the formal and physical sciences, we image silence and space to be fundamentally the same, so long as we presuppose a teleological mode of being.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Often it is claimed that religious thinkers fail to provide evidential support to their claims. As often as it is claimed, it is just as often incorrect. No one, surely, would say that Catholic and Christian theologians, of antiquity, especially, or modern theodicies fail to provide evidence for their claims. With all the burden of proof business, it's clear that a commitment to a certain <em>kind </em>of evidence is key. The burden of proof functions as a line drawn in the sand, constituted by social agreement, which demarcates, implicitly or explicitly, when one has ventured into unreliable assertion. The burden of proof does not itself possess substantive content, but rather acts as a conceptual tool for categorizing certain types of claims insofar as their content implies certain propositions. The burden is both a logical rule and a implicit normative evaluation of a claim. That said, the burden itself does not establish, of course, the truth or falsity of a claim, but rather enables one to identify the weighty logical ramifications which may obtain from certain claims.
<blockquote>A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined.</blockquote>
"...as a firm and unalterable experience has established" is operative here. Naturally, <em>any</em> invocation of Hume prompts one at least to reflect on his pernicious brand of skepticism. Statements of "The future will resemble the past" and its ilk aside, one may wonder what it means for <em>experience </em>to <em>establish </em>anything. Certainly it is not true that given a sufficient number of <em>experiences </em>a certain law <em>follows </em>from that total set of experiences.

In the quotation above, Hume seems to imply a third-party insofar as <em>something </em>is established; that is to say, an institution of some kind. Of course, from a modern scientist's belief, I would think, what Hume seems to be implicating is the <em>authority of peer review. </em>Or let us say: the institution of peer review. It would be laughable to assume that human experience <em>establishes </em>anything, especially <em>natural laws. </em>

But now, if this is the case, we need to fairly apply this interpretation to similar social groups, and perhaps reshape the behavior we understand concepts such as "evidence," "laws" and the burden of proof to have. If "establishment" is all that one can really achieve; that is, a concept fundamentally conceived as a <em>weight</em>, then such a weight should be no less present in exactly that tradition Hume seeks to undermine, or at any rate, what Humeans claim Hume to have undermined.

Certainly <em>religions can have their own notion of what </em>is <em>or is not </em>established. There's little rigor behind such a notion to begin with other than intersubjective agreement defined in terms of repeatability, predictability, falsifiability and so forth. However, <em>because </em>these methods persist within the scientific mode of experience, it does not follow that these practices define exhaustively what counts as <em>the right kind of evidence. </em>Often the scientific-atheist's argument ultimately turns on such a position, "Well, <em>this </em>is what we mean by evidence. <em>This </em>evidence comports with <em>this </em>practice."

The usual response to such a line of thought as I expose above is some accusation of relativism. All I mean to indicate is that <em>some pre-theoretical evaluation of practice takes place</em>, before one addresses the evidence in itself, whether it be a miracle or a comet dashing across the night sky. But perhaps we should take a step back: the aforementioned would be <em>merely phenomena </em>so indeed the <em>observation </em>of a miracle, should it happen, or a comet, is in itself <em>pre-theoretical. </em>Before any interpretation of the event takes place, there is simply the event as it occurs, or presumably occurs in the world. <em>Then </em>the effort of analyzing, interpreting and theorizing on the phenomenon takes place. I hazard this dissection for the point that <em>religious thinkers, like scientific thinkers, must first observe and </em>then <em>interpret. </em>The important point here ties us back to "evidence."

Atheistic thinkers will often criticism religious thinkers, apologetics, etc as if they had <em>no evidence </em>since revelation, miracles, providence, and the like are, to say the least, highly unreliable phenomena. But being unreliable does not say one way or the other what <em>influence such a kind of phenomena has on the language game of the person who professes to believe in such phenomena as evidence.</em> Unpredictable, unreliable, untestable, unfalsifiable; there is no shortage of pejorative or objectively fair points we can raise to such a belief, but <em>as evidence </em>do these phenomena play a role in the lives of those with religious sensibilities.

This, in part, points to what faith is about for the religious. Indeed, their form of evidence can be fairly criticized as being fundamentally based on unreliable, sporadic events (which they often construe by their narrative).]]></content:encoded>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"the two biggest problems in computer science naming things and " ...</p>
Well, I s'pose for fail of memory, such a gesture should suffice. In itself such a gesture is at once a response to a wider philosophical problem and an assertion against its constraints. The saying finishes off, to wit, is "cache invalidation." As a response, one must first confer that only under a certain context can an action be described. Indeed, an action may occur across multitudes of situations, but nevertheless description of the situation, or say event, is logically prior to the description of the action. One may grimace at the conflation of situation and event, and such a reaction is certainly due, for a "situation" is clearly more all-encompassing in terms of its connotative qualities. And one certainly would not readily identify an action as a situation, or if at all, such analysis would be rare still than as event. A broader notion of "event" is one I treat here, and so I will label it as a situation, treating it accordingly. What is more, my topic chiefly centers on the notion, regardless of substantive -- historical, cultural, conceptual, material -- content, that events do not exist, on premiss that they are not proper wholes. Thus, it would make little sense to agree to terms such that actions purely, as events, logically antecede a larger event which is causally constituted by its actions. An event, whether it exists or not, would be itself describable in terms of any number of contexts. We might call such a description a model or interpretation of that context.
<h2>Existentialist-ic Mooreans</h2>
In exploration of a greater, say existential,
<h2>Old but endearing problematics</h2>
Primarily because it resonates with old philosophical problems. The second component, quite explicitly. The former less so. Though the notion of cache in itself presupposes certain relations between entities qua agents. Systems, nodes, servers, clients, and their pushes and pulls, bidirectionality, etc. To me it says: "There are two problems in CS: the present application of set theoretical thinking and whether or not we are engaged in something called 'set theoretical thinking'." Thus, realism and nihilism.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A reply to Peter Vinton Jr.

Peter Vinton's title asks "And just where does `anarchy' fall on the spectrum again?" I was persuaded by an editor not to put my essay on this matter into an appendix of the book. I am not convinced that this omission was a good idea. Were it there, Vinton would have been answered and the ideological position of anarcho-liberalism might have been illuminated for other readers (maybe it can be in the next, a revised, edition). The short answer to his question is that anarchy is off the spectrum but on the compass. The long answer can be found here: <a href="http://www.la-articles.org.uk/pc.htm">http://www.la-articles.org.uk/pc.htm</a>.

My intention in writing Escape from Leviathan was, using the critical-rationalist epistemology, philosophically to defend (by responding to all the best or typical criticisms I could find) the social-scientific evidence (but certainly not summarizing it all) that private-property anarchy does not clash with either interpersonal liberty or human welfare (which italicised proposition I called the `extreme classical-liberal compatibility thesis'). I eschewed all moral advocacy as irrelevant and confusing, given the objective nature of my thesis. However, I did, where necessary, engage in meta-ethics to explain how morals and moralizing (but without any particular content) fitted with the rest of my arguments and theories. I emphatically did not avoid morals because I think morals are unimportant or irrelevant to all libertarian arguments, as some critics have supposed. Still less did I write the entire book out of a "desire to address the familiar argument that libertarian principles have no morality", as Vinton somewhat more strangely supposes.

The introduction explains-as its subheadings indicate-the classical-liberal compatibility thesis, why moral advocacy is avoided, and the critical-rationalist method. So I don't agree that it begins "with a `recap' of exactly what constitutes classical liberalism".

In the chapter on rationality I do not only, or mainly, look at altruism, as Vinton appears to suggest. I am attempting to give a comprehensive philosophical defence of aprioristic instrumental rationality. And I look only at the `logic' of altruism (and related aspects of morals), where I look at it at all, rather than "its underlying motivations". I nowhere suggest or imply the proposition that "an attitude of enlightened self-interest is actually a better framework for real altruism than the current atmosphere of welfare" (although I do argue that human welfare is best promoted by laissez-faire). Contra Vinton, I explicitly argue against the thesis that "[p]eople are naturally psychological egoists" and in favour of the thesis that altruism is genuine. Given the immediately previous quotation, he does not even appear to be consistent in what he asserts I say here. Nor do I suggest that "`self-perceived interest' is a better expression than `altruism'" but that it is clearer than `self interest'. And I explicitly defend, not reject, the view that "altruism implies having an interest in others as an end in itself."

It is a howler, given what I write in the book about `coercion', to state "The second part of the book ... explores the end results of coercion versus liberty". And it cannot be accurate to state that the book has "some refreshing new theories on what constitutes equitable redress." For equity (fairness in justice) is not discussed; nor is any theory of justice propounded. However, Vinton is right to note the novelty and, I hope, interest of the theory of liberty as `the absence of [proactively] imposed cost' and the consequences of applying this as a thought experiment in various simple situations.

In the chapter on welfare, I defend the view of (spontaneous-)want-satisfaction as a plausible theory of welfare for persons. That is not the same as advocating that people should be "embracing the motive of want-satisfaction". And to explain and defend the objective libertarian consequences of maximizing such welfare is not to argue that this "leads to a better system of social justice". That is just the kind of red herring about morals the book takes pains to avoid.

The single short sentence on the anarchy chapter does not contain any obvious inaccuracies.

Why do I reply to a review that does not appear to have any real criticisms and quite a few misunderstandings? I don't want to miss an opportunity to clarify what the book is about because I believe it to be both substantially true and morally urgent. However, I do not have high hopes of its being given wider consideration while the publishers continue to sell only the hardback at such a stiff price and while anti-libertarian professors prefer to repeat their old lectures on Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia. His book is often thought-provokingly clever but it is a justificationist, minarchist, ragbag bereft of a clear theory of liberty and its relation to property and human welfare.

I have replied elsewhere on the net to most other amazon.com reviews, which have sometimes appeared in longer forms first. Seek and ye shall find.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[She'll die when the last memory I have of her fades; and I never forget anything, perhaps on account of such peculiarities as my conception of memory at all. For me, quite genuinely, there is Substance. Call it archaic, but new languages should frighten you too. Within it, nothing dissipates, expires, ceases or any of that; all that occurs may be described as 'the modification of Substance.' As such I cannot fathom, as such a philosophical intersection demands, true loss of memory. Natural laws 'Modification' - [coma memories]

Existentialists typically hold to a distinction between the will of circumstance and the will of establishment. In addressing the will at all the philosophical limits go no further; adopting certain notions as permitted in application to the will while rejecting others in and of itself is an effort to prescribe a method for addressing the problem of the freedom of the will. Authors of this sort make it a habit, say, to belabor the niceties and trivialities of existence, through their letter, so as to convince one that certain of this rank of environmental garnish are important as to the inner experience of the author or protagonist, etc. Life, say, consists primarily of influences from external objects not governed within one's perception, objects physical and abstract. But subsumed under this class of external object are objects fixed and objects contingent, abstract, concrete, or not. The will may not be free in terms of fixed events which may describe one's life, but may also be liberated in certain ways by the governance those events play over others who are similarly so categorically influenced. The will may be free in contingency, which readily comes to the imagination, but may be paralyzed when laws, say of fixed spaces, govern.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monetization as a noble deployment toward terminable self-sustainability. Yet Text will ever be a possible value of currency.

Capitalism enriches one's imaginary of <em>failure </em>in a set of unique and specific ways, along the lines commonly understood as <em>narrative.</em> In one way, as with any narrative, the possibility of failure must be contained within the conceptual refinements of the narrative itself. Capital must speak its own failure; by way of the constituency of its conceptual hygiene: what can be said to be valid or invalid behavior along the strictures of the <em>narrative</em>. -- As yet, historically, the Text has the capacity of recursive meaning, which Money cannot possess. Why relate these disparate concepts? In that technology has reduced their apparent distinction, apparent value, commonly held, to something vague and often misleading.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's say that beauty is a talent. Why not? For in perception, beauty may be contrived or accidental, and in fabrication there should be no less mistake and miss of cue. We've touched on the word before, its role in language, namely to collect and swell with all the other properties, mundane to far-fetched and lovely. But is beauty a talent?

Doubting such would seem to imply that beauty is only natural. And more dishearteningly, that beauty cannot be the subject of refinement. And certainly one's own beauty may be extended to the world, a push of one's aesthetic. The externalization of beauty, then, we might call <em>aesthetic.</em>

The sexes: Women exact from me my talents in certain and undesirable ways. Men seem to lack refinement of beauty. A woman I might call <em>beautiful </em>and in a certain sense <em>interesting </em>but thus diminishing of sexual attractiveness. While the other lacks what I might call <em>beautiful </em>due to lack of refinement in talent.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let us imagine a gang of scientists -- on known assumption that in their culture they receive a dignified appellation "scientist," vaguely synonymous to our own -- who speak apparently eloquently and in long-winded fashion on unintelligible nonsense. Would we say, <em>They speak a different language?</em> In what sense would <em>we</em> mean "different language"? Breaking down and demonstrating the conceptual connections nonostensible and latent to such a phrasing is the job of the philosopher, for in common parlance and linguistic practice it is customarily assumed that concepts reveal themselves more readily in speech and writing in virtue of concrete connection with the tangible, historical markings and utterances who express and legitimate that "inner" conceptual space. The philosopher reminds us of our common assumption and the habitual mental and physical behaviors manifest in its implicit and explicit acceptance.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Some Meta-ethics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Beginning with the question: What is a "fact"? As with most philosophical jargonology, there's no <em>fact to the matter </em>as to what a fact truly amounts to. We do have distinctions, however: facts, theories, values, laws.

We have further distinctions, so it goes: Moral facts, ethical theories (not moral theories!), moral values (or just <em>values</em>), and moral laws (not legal laws; redundant?)
<h3>Moral Facts</h3>
Moral facts, as it follows from the widely adopted but nevertheless contentious, upon philosophical scrutinizing, take from the concept of <em>fact </em>the feature of being truth-makers. Moral facts make certain things true, whatever those things turn out to be. Often it is claimed that facts make propositions true; and propositions are expressed by statements, or sentences. More abstractly, and to the earlier point of contention, the world as a collection of facts makes propositions, expressed by sentences, or statements, or recordings, or pictures, etc., etc., true. So again it follows -- to keep to our P's and Q's, indeed -- the <em>moral </em>world makes our moral propositions true.

Well beyond me is it that such a slip in language could send us spiraling into centuries of <em>silence</em>, even if we have been <em>speaking</em> and <em>writing</em>. John Mackie had the right intuition by laying down his Argument from Queerness, where the basic intuition is: Let us observe <em>the World</em>, which we will take for granted, and the <em>Moral World</em>; what might an intersection between these worlds look like <em>to us </em>given our <em>epistemological </em>structuring, practices, methods, limits, etc. I place an emphasis on "Worlds" to underscore a metaphysical consideration which Mackie himself introduces. I formulate it in this way: Is the <em>posit </em>of the atom (or any analogous theoretical entity) <em>like </em>the posit of a moral fact? The problem centers on the intuition I believe most share that in positing even one moral fact, a <em>Moral World </em>is instantiated. Perhaps the first problem, then, is the flawed analogy between "moral facts" and "scientific theoretical entities": We need a fleshing out of "the moral fact" in the way that the atom or the motley crew of known subatomic particles <em>have been </em>fleshed out (in terms of indirect observational evidence, best inference, etc.). Before we address the difference in would-be-Worlds, we have to first address the plain linguistic counter-intuition. <em>Facts </em>are not <em>simples </em>like <em>atoms, bosons, quarks; </em>moreover, facts would fall under the heading <em>necessarily complex</em>; whereas the <em>categorical ancestor of the atom </em>is <em>potentially simple. </em>Perhaps another way to put this is: <em>Facts are necessarily irreducible; </em>whereas atoms are domain-specific (say, to physics). (Naturally the implication here is that there is something to which the entities and laws of physics are reducible; and I'm fine with this.)

In ordinary speaking the Fact is not explicitly or implicitly presupposed. ...
<h3>Ethical and Moral Theories</h3>
Let's keep this clean: a moral theory is such a theory that we may attribute to a moral agent in the event of practical moral theorizing. A moral agent produces a moral theory at certain points in his or her life so as to resolve a moral conflict. We might say that the moral theory is a conceptual child to the "critical moral attitude"; where such an attitude is marked by introspection, skepticism, grades of emotional detachment, etc. -- something akin to R. Hare's "critical level" of moral thinking (as opposed to the intuitive level).

An ethical theory speaks on moral decision making, its processes, structures, results of moral agents who, here and there, undertake moral theorizing. An ethical theory takes on the various modes of moral thought (consequence-based, rule-based, character-based, etc.) and attempts to determine the <em>right one </em>over <em>classes of moral situations </em>or <em>individual moral situations. </em>So an author may advance an ethical theory which may be described as "utilitarian" or "Millian" if that author deems a fundamentally consequence-based mode of moral thought the best fit; or an author may be counted as a "Kantian" if one judges that the class of all moral situations are best dealt with, not only under a deontological, or rule-based mode of thought, but moreover under a distinct or derivative Kantian mode of moral thought. It is the ethical theories chief business to provide reasons as to why one mode of moral thinking is best for the relevance classes of moral situations; moreover, to defend its coherency against its detractors; to provide its basic structure and categorization; to expose the nature of its values; and to orient and inform its base language for communication of those basic values; and to reveal to unique logic it bears; and to establish its overlap with everyday moral intuitions, should it deviate, at the letter, very far from them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My sister and I rarely speak to one another. Asserting with less pride than regret, she and I grew up in no less than utterly different worlds, reasonably underestimating -- through the years, up 'til this point -- the narratives of the other. Through an unfortunate draw of the card, we knew less of what it meant to be siblings than what it meant to maintain a stable inner solace, but as we slowly drift into the way things typically even out to be, we're learning, surely, that the sage-like introspective internalizations of our hermetic childhoods, intentional and sometimes not, will only structure the inevitable later realized tie which binds us: our Mother. But she's no Saint.

I s'pose she's grown. I have the most inchoate snapshots of her personal progression, and even then which are few and far. But somehow, I'm s'posin' she's grown -- matured, as if it were even in my right to make such claim. I'm no genuine brother, but yet something in my blood dares me to hazard a boldness, a confidence, and compassion.

"We're happy when we're alone" she said. Yet what has plagued me? -- "You'll never be happy"; mutually agreed upon by closed friends who may as well have printed the script beforehand.

No wonder why I'm miserable, as I laugh for the first time at anything my father has ever said. And even still, likely an echo from before my last good night's rest.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(since I never got your number:) I cannot picture a world wherein last  night, this morning, and all the rest, fails to happen. At the risk of  sounding immature and all, I really do hope you enjoyed our reckless  little sex-tantrum. And I hope you're physically all right.

That  night, this morning, will, of course, be the subject of much personal,  inner musings for quite some time, years perhaps; decades, with hope.  This morning felt -- every word we shared, every grope, thought, thrust,  scratch and claw and kiss -- it felt like the utmost necessity of  Nature (I'm still a sap for Spinoza). For ill or good, I can only feel  that it simply had to happen. Where I come in: I'm glad that it did.

Whatever  the interpretation, I must know, if nothing else, that you made it  safely and timely on your way to that new departure of yours. It's  nothing less than impressive, from what little I know about the world of  academia, and I hope your classes go well.

I'm not sure how you  feel, and you may never ever wish to tell me, but I conjure that we  have set aright the World in some twisted, manic and disagreeable way.  Sure: drunk to begin with, but toward the morning hours? And all those  peculiar qualities about myself; how surprising and moving that you  should recall them so readily. Either you've had something up your  sleeve since the day we met, or you're an elephant. I don't know;  perhaps I shouldn't?

To say the least, I think we portayed a good  drama. I recognize, of course, that at some layer of the confounding  drawn-out dance between us, and perhaps in spite of the visceral night  we leave behind, you aim to perserve a pitiable, naive, innoncent,  enfeebled, incapable me, as an image to take with you well into the far  future reaches of your life. True enough, I concede, one may find  infinite romance in unrealized possibilities. I do apologize for  infringing upon, and perhaps marring, such well kept or safe-guarded  figurine, so installed in the every-now-and-then recollections of what  you leave behind.

I don't feel it my right to put a seal on  anything, but on the other hand, we are clearly set in divergent  trajectories, for the time being, anyway. For the time being: How can I  say that with real emphasis, beyond the typograhical? Who can really  say? And what use is there in saying "if only had we done all this  sooner"? And what's more, you are under a certain impression: where you  are, as you say, "a bitch." Naturally, I can only disagree; how could I  possibly do otherwise? All I can say is that I find you to be uniquely  fascinating, for whatever words are worth. It is your vibrant mind,  frenetic persona, devilish charm... these are how I see you in the  abstract. I'll take these lonely words over "bitch," yes.

I  s'pose I've rambled on more than enough. I'm starting to find myself  intolerable. I'd like to say, though, that we should correspond (through  postage perhaps?), but I really don't know where we stand, or if we  stand, or what -- maybe I overestimate the gravity of all of this.

Terms  aside, as I'm sure they will unfold in time, I will just get to my  bittersweet farewell, should nothing more come to between us now, fifty  years hence, or anywhere in between.

That is to say, with my own juvenile twist on Andrew Marvell's "To His Coy Mistress":

Yonder all before us lie.
Desserts* of vast eternity.

Farewell,
in a way,
Athena]]></content:encoded>

We have "language," "meaning," "ordinary" and "life."

Language may be viewed as a combination of syntactic and semantic rules. With these in place, we may draw literal inferences, where "literal" is meant to constrain the language to no more than talking about itself. Thus, we may look at language, in this sense, as empty, or vacuous, symbolism. By "semantic" rules, we mean not to say that the language, or kind of language, in question talks about anything in the World, but rather states of affairs which do or do not obtain. So, the semantics of such a language amounts to the True or the False. Propositions of such a language point to the True or the False. Such a language bears semantics which extend nowhere beyond this. Semantics in a wider sense involves meaning in a wider sense: involving connotations, subjective meanings, the World, etc. Semantics of our "dried out" language stands outside the World.

Meaning, of this wider sense, is conjoined with language of our prior description]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The mereological fallacy is committed when one assumes of substantives, which are picked out by nouns and noun phrases, that they are semantically coextensive, despite being in possession of a dissimilar categorical, or logical, form. The presumption hinges on a superficial, or I should say "naive," (in the technical sense) apprehension of <em>proximity </em>between discrete entities.

For instance, "Sam" and "Sam's stomach" may intelligibly, and validly (semantically), be substituted in the statement "X digested Y" in some cases. Our intuitions are not rubbed the wrong way. We <em>get </em>what is meant; but at the same time we understand that in a "broad" sense Sam digests his meal in a logically connected way to the "narrow" sense that his stomach digests (what the science reveals to us as the specifics and going-ons of the digestive system and its process). "To digest" carries with it a "semantic field" which accepts, by the conventions of our language, both entities without damage to sense. We see an obviously <em>physical </em>connection between both Sam and his own stomach, by way of the latter being a <em>proper logical part</em> to Sam. However, the <em>meaningfulness </em>of that connection is established by way of an empirical state of affairs.

The meaty question amounts to in virtue of what is "form" established? The primary suspect for the mereological fallacy is the kind of thinking which ignores <em>obvious </em>semantic discontinuity between terms. The vulgar example, of course, is manifest in the claim that "Sam" and "Sam's brain" are semantically coextensive, or coreferential, in some cases. A central distinction that must be noted is that between universal and existential claims. In the case of digestion, it is plain that varying expressions that intimate or state exactly]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Moore's paradox: </em>In the first person, it cannot be <em>asserted</em> or<em> believed</em>, without contradiction, <em>both</em> that <em>p</em> and that <em>one believes </em>either <em>that not-p</em> or <em>does not believe that p</em>. The former is the <em>commissive </em>paradox while the latter invokes the <em>omissive </em>paradox. Asserted or believed <em>independently, under questionable epistemic circumstances </em>(experimental, "limit testing" scenarios), <em>under coercion, in the past tense, </em>or <em>from the second- and third-person </em>no paradox persists.
<h2>Types of paradox</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Commissive paradox: <em>p </em>and <em>I believe that not-p</em>.</li>
	<li>Omissive: <em>p</em> and <em>I do not believe that p</em>.</li>
</ol>
So,
<ol>
	<li>(p) &amp; B~(p)</li>
	<li>(p) &amp; ~B(p)</li>
</ol>
respectively. Prima facie, these do not formally look like paradoxes, but we must say that when conjoined a paradox emerges.
<h2>Problematic</h2>
<em>Why </em>is this a paradox? Explain it as a paradox, assuming that it is truly a paradox; or demonstrate why it is not in fact a paradox. <em>What </em>makes such a situation <em>paradoxical?</em>
<h2>Expansion approach</h2>
Generally speaking, assertions <em>expand </em>to beliefs, or rather assertions are maskings of beliefs. Strictly speaking, assertions imply belief. So, the semantic value of an assertion is the belief of the proposition. Assertions <em>mean </em>beliefs. Manifold questions, of course, naturally reveal themselves in consideration of such an assumption: What are the sociological, philosophical, linguistic, pragmatic consequences of such a view? Moreover, we must look at what determines the <em>sense </em>in which an assertion is a belief. By "sense" I mean whether a belief is held as true, false, probable, etc. We may require to look at the pragmatic or contextual constraints under which the assertion emerges. We may, perhaps, make a distinction between <em>believing </em>and <em>believing to be true. </em>Under this view, do we <em>assume </em>that all assertions are made under the constraint of tending to truth? Well, this is the common understanding of assertion.

But an "assertion" is a phenomena that stands in need of explanation. We <em>call </em>a proposition on paper a "proposition," but what makes it an assertion? A mental state? A conversational inertia? Are we <em>compelled </em>to make assertions? Can we look <em>as if </em>to assert a proposition while not in fact doing so? (Speech act theory)

More to the point: Assertions such that <em>p </em>are in fact abbreviations of believe statements. Thus, <em>p </em>expands to <em>I believe that p. </em>Therefore, we arrive at the paradoxical situation, under the <em>omissive paradox</em>:
<p style="text-align: center;">I believe that p &amp; I do not believe that p</p>

That is,
<p style="text-align: center;">B(p) &amp; ~B(p)</p>

However, under the commissive interpretation, we arrive at the following.
<p style="text-align: center;">I believe that p &amp; I believe that not-p</p>

Under the commissive interpretation, we arrive at no paradox; notably,
<p style="text-align: center;">B(p) &amp; B(~p)</p>

<h2>Minimizing approach</h2>
The converse of the above view gives us the minimizing approach. Belief statements reduce to assertions. Beliefs are in fact assertions. The semantic material of belief is exhausted by assertion; belief <em>means </em>assertion.

So, the proposition that <em>I believe that p</em> becomes <em>p</em>. In similar fashion, we arrive at the following, under the commissive paradox.
<p style="text-align: center;">p &amp; not-p</p>

That is,
<p style="text-align: center;">(p) &amp; ~(p)</p>

Yet what of the omissive situation? That is, what would "I do not believe that p" mean under this minimizing approach? What would it "reduce" to? Let's ask: Would one assert what one does not believe? Well, purportedly, at the level of belief, the paradox persists. Would we arrive at the following?
<p style="text-align: center;">p &amp; not-p</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It seems that this view may imply a convergence between the omissive and commissive paradoxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have a matrix.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Omissive paradox at the level of belief Commissive at the level of belief</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From very early on (pre-adolescence), one could find in me a general tendency and desire to deconstruct material objects, usually of mundane complexity (Legos, computing machines, circuit boards, etc). With Legos the realization of a deconstructive effort was ultimately the point (in case such an example is not obvious; and so that we need not entertain drab borderline cases where creation and destruction equally apply). The talent, if we can call it that, was by no means extraordinary -- hardly even worth mentioning at a family gathering before one's spouse's folks. But I'll mention it here, since it pertains.

Such a penchant spilled over into my time spent in high school, wherein critique of the vernacular of my peers raised suspicion toward my commitment to social ties. The corrective mood was easily mobilized by every grammatical quirk; but I was often led to the belief that surely <em>I </em>could not be a divine philologist or a ---

I am a human of mediocre intelligence, or so I'd be willing to bet. And in terms of quantification of my vocabulary, I doubt my chips would receive anything more than pity. Perhaps I am what's called an "avid reader," but I really have no means of comparison. All this is to say, I doubt that I am very "smart" by the usual standard.

In taking refuge with the philosophers, I took myself to be landing upon estimable grounds -- well, not consciously anyway. I actually thought undertaking a regime in rigors of philosophy would aid me in fostering a level of precision of articulation that might undermine many of my almost denumerable issues with linguistic performance. But this sadly did little toward that end.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[They were regulars to a local open mic, recurring every Monday on a corner in some quaint, ugly neighborhood. He was oblivious to just about every going-on conventional to their cozy, little proto-culture; or at least this was his continual effort to be. Deftly so, he knew, or rather assumed, he could identify the vagaries manifest in conversation and exploit, surreptitiously of course, his audience into condescending their spirits, their wits, to draw joy from his whilings. He was crafty and nondescript, or so he aspired to be. He figure that he should excel at nothing thereby excel at not even the meager, trivial things; the audience can only makes note of consistent flagrancy. And exception in a vacuum only leads one to wonder at the concept of a vacuum. He had hoped to croak at thirty, but for him every day simply felt more difficult to complete, and as if an objective must obtain. Why -- or how -- was he connected to this necessity? Ask an amateur philosopher, fill in a Form, but don't ask me; I leave philosophy for those <em>willing </em>to see. But he dealt in such farcical entreaties, bringing Socrates to his knees and all that. I'm not much for rhyming either, so don't expect much more of that our of me in this tale, which I should probably get back to.

He played the harmonica, blues in an unkept way, or perhaps the expected way. And she would learn guitar for an audience, always handsomely prepared, with sheet music and shine. This, primarily, was what tickled his mind. <em>Just where did her confidence come from? </em>More importantly, <em>Could this be an irrelevant question? </em>How could it? Perhaps such a tiff should trouble my mind too. And what was she after? Doubtful anything; maybe just a warm shoulder or his frizzy, vulgar hair. It was probably just the open mic that attracted her: good friends, foreign talents, deliciously awful comedians here and there. But that complements them too much. This would be the simplest theory, but simply theories make for boring stories. So, we'll go with <em>that she was arrested by some complexity in him. </em>And perhaps there was. He deplored the standard interpretations of Cantor's proof, and called just about everything philosophical "insens."

She had a timorous, clumsy beauty about her, and as I pointed out earlier, she had attained a better-described-as-endearing mastery of guitar. He wasn't much a fan of guitar, except for those quiet, empty nights where he would seclude himself to a pitch black room with his audience, always clandestinely in chairs.]]></content:encoded>

Well, they're not orderly.

No one ever thinks of buildings as children. They never dance, or chant, or cry, or soil themselves. Follow me?

Not at all.

I couldn't go on. I terminate in light of the phrase "I cannot go on."

So will you jump now? Are you sufficiently convinced?

Someone told me that you had training in these matters. I'm not convinced of that, on top of the rest of it.
Mr. Cornwell
We usually start from a uncertainty only to arrive at unheard of depths.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I keep big friends because they're easier to find
And we keep to this pitiful world, laughing
colliding, persuaded by the tumultuous situations
which flux and form from our fathomable fervor

Time not for threnodies or enemies, but animosity
for smaller and smaller minds who see never the
pleasure in whiskey, 'til dawn we are pawns rushing
the invariably rigid streets -- we never cease gushing

Contemptible hushing and scare tactic blushing
invoke an Ode to Charlie Parker, who eternally resides
in the unfolded, unrealized distributions of our minds;
pining, we crumble at the sonic shores of Mr. Parker

Dejected and fell in a splendid world, but tethered to
the roaming rife rumbling, salient and solid, keeping
each of us as towers tilting toward Tennessee, turned
by a torrid, trembling and tempting tinkering together ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The philosopher marks for us the answers to the obvious questions. In everyday conversation, the philosopher wrangles us into a childish way of moving, gesturing, and posturing ourselves. We say, "But your way of talking is cumbersome, slow, and resistant to advancement -- where is the utility in your way of talking?"; as if almost to assert that the philosopher is antagonistic to a certain theory or push.

The philosopher seeks understanding. One way to go about securing understanding is to collapse complexity in language. Language, with its myriad forms of representation, -- and this is, of course, an inherited, tired mantra -- sets traps. Naturally one might accuse that a teleological assumption is being couched within this claim. The counter-assumption, which intuitively emerges, is that <em>everyone understands the grammar instantiated within a conversation. </em>So when A speaks with B, A and B share a grammar which, C, D, E, and so on, might readily and easily follow. Street grammar, say, is something we all share and can understand. Thus, we have the accept of an agreement. Certainly this is not doubted; that something binds and unifies us. But when we speak of <em>representation </em>in virtue of language a snag must be clear.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Knowledge as True Belief</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, I'm going to take the position. Why? I think it will get me around the Gettier problem and Gettier-type cases. So instead of having to give a fourth condition to knowledge (when combined with the other three, they give the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge), I only have to give two (albeit a really damn convincing account of those two).

This one philosopher similarly took this route in 1991 in an article titled "Knowledge is merely true belief." Here are some of the moves he makes.
(1) Thinking this notion is silly or "pernicious" is not to bring an argument against it.
(2) We can ask of the epistemological thought experiment: <em>Is that really a case of belief?</em> or are you deliberately (or perhaps tacitly) doing damage to our conventional notion of belief a disservice to make me think that you're licensed to bring justification in, that knowledge <em>needs</em> justification. Epistemologists tend to give impoverished accounts of "belief." Naturally, we need a rich enough notion of belief that does not in any way involve any feature of "justification."


Beliefs presuppose
(a) understanding the meaning of the terms of the belief, 
(b) commitment to the belief]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We do not think <em>in </em>any medium. We think <em>into </em>language, not in language. Thought is not a quasi-language or a quasi-method of expression. To use idiom such as "the language of thought" is to speak figuratively. A necessary condition for a word is that it consist of a finite concatenation of symbols or markings; a picture a finite set of strokes, markings, shapes, lines, etc. Thoughts, or thinking, do not satisfy, and thus do not depend upon or presuppose, such a necessary condition. Thus, to claim that we think in terms of words or pictures or symbols is to claim something that is literally false.]]></content:encoded>

By <em>art </em>I understand the necessity of human expression coupled with the constraining force of human limitation. Where expression is unlimited under a certain principle; where human limitation involves those aspects of the physical world and its contingency. Thus, art is an necessary expression moulded by the contingent state of affairs.

		<title>Non-cognitivism about morality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A cognitivist holds that moral propositions are truth-apt. A truth-apt proposition is one that has the capacity to record a fact of the world. A fact of the world is that which can be true or false of a state of affairs. Thus, a cognitivist holds that moral propositions express facts about the world, wherein the moral proposition is false just in case the fact which it purports to be the case is not the case.

A moral proposition is false just in case the fact which it purports to be the case is not the case. A fact's being the case or not being the case is a matter of whether or not it obtains. That which is obtainable <em>can </em>be expressed; therefore, a proposition, generally speaking, <em>could </em>express it.

What obtains when a fact is the case is the arrangement of properties of the state of affairs. The features, that is, of the state of affairs stand in a certain relation to one another. By the proposition that the house is the left of the tree, it is expressed that a house stands in a particular relation to the tree. The house, the tree and the relation are properties of the event that obtains.

A fact is an event. No fact exists outside of the event of perceiving it. Thus, the proposition which records a fact of the world, a particular state of affairs, only does so in virtue of the fact's capacity to be perceived. An observer is essential to the status of the fact. Outside of the world of occurring events, facts do not exist. For to say that they do, we would be saying that facts persist outside of the world of occurring events. But do facts <em>persist in the world of occurring events? </em>This question seems equally difficult to answer.

The space of events is the space of facts. A fact exists only insofar as it can be perceived through an event. The identification of the fact is itself an event. The fact is shaped by the identification. A fact is such under a particular context. What would we say of a context-free fact? A mathematical statement is true irrespective to any observer <em>identifying </em>or <em>acknowledging</em> it? When a thing is true, we can either praise or blame it. But what does it mean to say of a thing that it is true but we might never be in a position to praise it or acknowledge its pleasing feel? A statement true in virtue of its connection to us.]]></content:encoded>

Most scientists are committed to the claim that unobservable entities (theoretical posits of science: quarks, Higgs bosons, elementary particles, strings, viruses, radiowaves, molecules, etc), have reality ("really exist") to the same extent as everyday objects (chairs, books, cars, humans, etc). That is, the language of science achieves a correspondence, through its descriptions or descriptive powers, with "reality" to the same degree or with the same level of satisfaction as ordinary language. Moreover, (most) scientists believe that we know about these unseen objects. Our knowledge of them is guaranteed by our theories about them.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Philosophy as the logical clarification of language</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Philosophy is nothing more than the activity of philosophers. For a culture, it is a matter of course where some of its members fall under the criteria of meeting description of a philosopher. The meaning of philosophy, and all that one could hope to mean when one talks about philosophy, then, is exhausted by the activity of just those persons who meet the criteria under the everyday description. The distinction between academic philosophy and amateur philosophy indicate nothing more than an artificial demarcation made by the implicit, and often explicit, human tendency to recognize authority, "as such" as one might say within a language game.

Can we say that academic philosophy <em>really </em>amounts to institutionalized philosophy? One has access to exactly those works of "academic" literature as would any institution(alized) philosopher. What is missing from the predicate is the aspect of unified social form. Philosophy of the university is its own language game, and this should be obvious. Wherein the notion of academic philosophy concepts of rigor, consistency, scope, purpose, agenda, micro-analytics, attention to language, structuring, philosophical patience, <em>distinction, </em>and so on are seriously brought to the fore, expected and sometimes realized. House philosophers certainly hold such virtues, or perhaps we should just call them <em>habits; </em>however, it is easy to see <em>presumption</em> infiltrate any School.

Houses and Schools are quite different as concepts of institution. The latter's existence is manifest in the -ism and "one's philosophy" mentality. Forms of life center on or are outgrowths from a position on a singular claim. The presumption is that one, under a particular potential or putative School, has identified exactly those key concepts relevant to the perpetuation of a language game. One does not intend merely the continuation of a game, though it is a consequence, and this is what I focus on. I do not doubt that key concepts play a pivotal role in proper communication and cognition. What is my concern is that pieces of language <em>capture </em>just those key concepts in just the way that <em>gets </em>one to the kernel of a language game. There is no "center" to a language game; "key concept," or "capital concept," is similar to the king in chess.]]></content:encoded>

With simultaneity each woman, child, man --
Each flame, transaction, pathway, picture, spirit
Dream of the ethereal and the Other, order
And avalanche underflow the climate of night
Only through the space of visceral unwaking--
A chaotic carrying on carries on beneath
The covers of eyelids and an unsettling proximity
To death --

Passions govern grievances and the transubstantiation
Of wares into wars; traders tumble tragically together
In this world of commerce and rationality; Children
chant mechanically beautiful artifacts passing through
Their hollowed cores, laying voice as labor, bit by bit
On the essence of an edifice whose basic need is nothing
More than their eternal unrequite: a sleeper's refusal
Fall quietly unto the pillows of return]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Remarks on HTML 5</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/?p=1165</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Source material:

http://xhtml.com/en/future/x-html-5-versus-xhtml-2/#x5-uncool-sectioning

http://www.w3schools.com/tags/html5.asp

http://nettuts.s3.amazonaws.com/373_html5/final/index.html

Over the next few posts, I will provide commentary, derived from my experience in learning and analyzing HTML 5, to its specification, the language itself, and recent developers' interpretations of HTML 5 along with their practices and executions on their own interpretations.
<h3>The politics</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> has pushed <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/">XHTML 2.0</a> to the side, where in its stead they have adopted <acronym title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">WHATWG</acronym>'s <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/">HTML 5</a> as the markup language on which they will continue their work and development toward a future, deliverable HTML specification.</em></p>

<em>XHTML 2.0</em>'s development aimed at being a strictly normative specification as to how markup ought to be developed for Web applications and Web sites. The W3C's Recommendation of XHTML 2.0, were it to have been continued, would have been completely normative in that its development is not at all a reflection of current development practices which involve (X)HTML(what developers are currently doing out "in the field" under Web application projects, Web sites, etc).

(X)HTML 5 more so mirror's current trends in development through HTML.
<h3>A new anatomy</h3>
First, an outline of the tags introduced with HTML 5. I will offer comment of, and raise question to, their purpose, meaning, function, etc.

<dl> <dt><code>&lt;section&gt;</code></dt> <dd> <em>Purpose:</em> Demarcation at the layout level. Design-oriented. A section is an aspect of a Web page or Web site. The section, therefore, is more meaningful to the reader. So, the section has, or it must have, a greater semantic value than the division tag.
<em>Semantic:</em> This tag is not equivalent to <code>div</code> tag.
<em>Function:</em> Functionally, it is similar to the <code>div</code> both DOM-wise and attribute-wise. However, as seen in its Purpose, the section tag's function, though it can be accomplished by the div tag all the same, goes semantically beyond that for which the div tag is intended. The div tag is merely a structural division. A section tag is a division in the design concept. For instance, in XHTML 1.0 or HTML 4, we may use a div tag to separate the content and the form on a blog entry. However, these are properly sections of the entire blog entry page. To the page's design concept, these are divisions. <code>div</code> tags alone identify structural divisions in the document. </dd> <dt><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></dt> <dd>...</dd> <dt><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></dt> <dd>...</dd> <dt><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></dt> <dd>...</dd> <dt><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></dt> <dd>...</dd> <dt><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></dt> <dd>...</dd> </dl>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Markup Naming Conventions</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/?p=1312</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've committed much thinking over the past few days over what I call the dilemma of naming conventions.

It is a problematic in that the Web is generally a hostile environment to develop in. The issue is similar to development under JavaScript. Whereas the expected client-side domain is subject to the flux of the browser market, where at base the core set of popular Web browsers ground that domain, for Web developers, or "front-end engineers," the expected domain for naming conventions is grounded by the onslaught of recent (Web) resource description languages (eRDF, RDFa, Microformats, vCard, etc.) or ontological idioms (OWL, etc.).

What is demanded, then, of a Web developer is forward-thought as to how her own Web project will integrate with pre-existing and future ontological-linguistic paradigms. Depending on the incorporation of this linguistic models by search engines (Google, Bing, etc), a Web project may literally define itself outside of the parameters of search engine algorithms. Sure, at bottom, we've got primitive linguistic paradigms on which these algorithms work, but I can easily imagine meta-data as becoming that channel through which search engine algorithms derive their about-ness of a Website.

The crux of the problem that forced search engines to diminish authority of (meta-)keywords was abuse. The solution came from the assumption that the content itself implies a truer statement of the general nature of its whole (the Website). With these ontological-descriptive languages, we seem to revisit the spirit of the keywords approach; however, we approach things a bit differently. Semantic weight is distributed more evenly throughout the page or document (or Website). And this, I presume, factors into pre-existing natural language inference algorithms.

That's fine. But Web developers are left with the task of devising naming schemes on which to future-proof their projects. These new linguistic models impose requirements which one meets or fails to meet in virtue of their producing a naming convention more or less harmonious which those requirements. In one sense, we're being told how to think about our Web projects. In one way, it's beneficial for the sake of universal simplicity, but at the cost of potential creativity.

Sure, one may not think it very worthwhile to wax creative about what to call a street address or a telephone number. I doubt recommend that one go against well-established traditions, however accurate. These resource description approaches, in one way, merely mirror those traditions. And even then, this is quite a different battle.

What about structural semantics?

Are you very committed to what may be called a sidebar or a navigation block?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 Any language L will, as a successful theory of truth must flesh out, consist of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic structures.
1.1 To take the usual route, I will begin will syntax. I would not like to think syntax is so straight-forward, for it is exactly the mapping of meaning to the sentences of L which should no easily bring difficulty to all co-related theories.

2 Of a syntactic structure extant are marks for arrangement which provide a <em>sensible</em> component to that language. Although, it is not necessary that the language in question must needs a written mode of expression. Propositions, that is, can be expressed phonetically only within L; this should be common knowledge.
2.1 L may contain symbols as its constituents when and only when marks are arranged in such a fashion as to demarcate one set of symbols (or an unitary set) from another set of symbols. Symbols for L are complexes of marks, but symbols themselves will be complex simples; thus, a symbol for L cannot be broken down into its constituent marks so as to presuppose a meaning for the marks which compose a meaning for the symbol so composed. Principle of Non-recursive Deconstruction [of Symbols].
2.2 Symbols may become Words (as principle dependent upon the Pragmatic structure): Words will simply be symbols that are recognizable by language speakers of L. The vocabulary of L is an ontology of symbols which are "easily cognizable" to the set of all speakers of L.
2.21 The quantity of speakers is important: "Speakers of L" presupposes that no private language is possible, which is an axiom of this system. It seems that to use "speakers of" at all presupposes that the speakers speak to each other with some degree of intelligibility and success. Though, we can say that "intelligibility" and "success of communication" are properties that independently describe L from an observer's reference. Suppose 2 speakers of L: a word for the mutual speakers will be an arbitrary agreement to a set of marks (or a symbol) that poses no obvious loss or gain.
2.211 "Lose or gain" suggests that the agreement is founded on a principle, although rarely obvious to the speakers of L. We do not have to construe this "agreement" as positive or negative in consequences to the speakers of L. Thus, it is not necessary to suggest that the speakers of L consciously agree to symbols on a regular basis so as to bolster warm relations between them. Further, no degree of "trust" is required in "agreeing to a name" for words such as "tree," "mountain," "food," etc. Words do not carry with them a meaning, but the meaning is manifest in the agreement. This "meaning" of a word depends on its accidental explicit expression within a proposition.
2.3 An account for "proposition" is in due course, but for our focus on syntactic structure, a proposition can take on its usual role of at least being immaterial in the sense that tangible objects (sequences of marks and symbols, to be clear) express them. The proposition is the sense which can be expressed all the same through any arbitrary set of sequences of marks and symbols.

3 Semantic
3.1 Let us accept semantic holism but deal first with the traditional dilemmas which are manifest in postulating it.
3.2 We first ask such questions of L: Is L finite or infinite? what exactly does this mean? does L consist of an infinity of syntactic objects (this is self-evidently absurd)? but what of meanings--can meanings exist which are "in-themselves," as it were? that is, are there meanings expressed independently of sentential functions which express them? who would express them? But the assumption is that L is finite in syntactic objects at time t; further, multiple sentential functions can be mapped to a sense in order to express it. Two sentences can express the same sense: "a new sun", "the rising sun is here", etc.

4 Pragmatic]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Trey introduced me to the spindle cell and we elucidate for ourselves the notion of non-disadvantage features/mutations. Disadvantageous features will be weeded out by natural selection and advantageous features will increase the adaptability of the population which in turn increases that population's probability of passing on its genes for future generations. Speciation is a by-product of this process. A species is, more or less, a snapshot of the microstructural fixed state of the species (at the species level) at some arbitrary point in time. However, non-disadvantageous mutations will not necessarily "fall out" of the process. Imagine a neutral feature of a species that plays (approximately) no role in its species-survival, yet nevertheless this mutational feature gets passed on. This is where spindle cells, as is purported, come in. They are meant to account for our higher level emotions which are apparently not necessary for our species survival. In contrast to apes, etc., these spindle cells exist in a higher quantity within us than our nearest kin (at the species level). Do these apes not express higher level emotions? Are these emotions irrelevant to survival?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pierre croit que Londres est jolie.

(T)ranslation: If S expresses a truth in L, then an adequate translation of S as S' in L also expresses a truth.

Possible translations:

(1) Peter believes London is pretty.
(2) Pierre believes London is pretty.
(3) Peter believes Londres is pretty.
(4) Pierre believes Londres is pretty.

(1) and (3) are "strict" or "strong" interpretations of (T). I make this point because it seems plausible to concern ourselves with the logical status of the two names used within the proposition. What would be our justification for translating "Londres" but not "Pierre"? Naturally, we say that though Pierre's name may change, he (in any of his features other than his name) does not. In translating "Londres," none of its features change either. (It's still the capital of England, it's still a city, and it's still pretty so far as Pierre/Peter is concerned.) So we can say (5) "Pierre believes L(english) is pretty" and (6) "Pierre croit que L(french) est jolie." Both (5) and (6) are true, regardless of their presentation in different language.

(D)isquotation: Ceteris paribus, if S sincerely assents to "p," then we may conclude that S believes that p.

Notice, however, that upon asking Pierre if he assents to p, we will drop the added "(language)" locution. It would not appear in our question, of course. Two facts are missing from Pierre's epistemic context: (i) he does not know "London" and "Londres" have the same referent and (ii) he does not know that "London" and "Londres" are translation equivalents; he has not stumbled onto a dictionary that would indirectly reveal fact (i). To suggest (ii) might be to suggest that we can ask something about the term which is a constituent of the statement p. Pierre is predicating of his referent, not predicating of the word itself.

Pierre lands in London, learns the language of the natives through immersion, and is found in the following situation. Pierre comes to learn that London is a pretty ugly place. He's disposed to utter, "London is not pretty." He could say it in the French and in the English.

(7) Pierre believes London is not pretty.
(8) Pierre croit que Londres n'est pas jolie.

The "Jen Solution" requires that (7) and (8) would accurately describe Pierre. (9) and (10) would present a problem.

(9) Pierre does not believe London is pretty.
(10) Pierre ne croit pas que Londres est jolie.

(9) and (10) have "wide scope" while (7) and (8) have "narrow scope." (9) and (10) bind the variable L within the scope of "believes".]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Claim:</strong> An artificially intelligent agent could satisfy those same conditions under which we ascribe (R)ationality, (W)ill (as freedom of action), (R)responsibility, strong (A)ccountability, (M)oral intelligence and (G)eneral intelligence.

<strong>Premise:</strong> Each of these properties, which function as description of a human being, or set of human beings, <em>can only be</em>, or necessarily are, applied within some public context.

This premise rules out situations, or experiments, in which a one-to-one correspondence between AI-agent and human-agent give us any legitimate conclusion to make about the nature of the AI-agent. It seems unfair to base our final judgment on an experiment involving isolated use of language. For instance, the Chinese room argument proposed by Searle has us look at a "free environment," where no restriction on the goal of discourse is given. In effect, the AI-agent and the human-agent are given no topic, or guideline to follow. These agents are simply given language as such, and the end set before them is absent. What relevantly follows, I think, is that the AI-agent cannot engage in "small talk." With public context, I believe, comes a more immediate consequence of the talk exchange: public context presupposes a potential connection with other contexts.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pierre believes London is pretty.

Expanded Fregean Form: There is some, or at least one, mode of presentation under which Pierre believes London is pretty.

Does this answer the question: <em>Does Pierre believe London is pretty?</em>

Does "London" refer to the actual city of London, or does it refer to the object of the mode of presentation? Do modes of presentation have objects? Do names refer to objects in the world or objects contained within modes of presentation? Event1 and Event2 will contain different modes of presentation occurring at temporal points very close in proximity. When a Subject utters something about an object involved in Event1 at Event2 will that Subject be referring to the object itself or the object of the mode of presentation "kept" or "transferred" into the following event?

More straightforwardly: There is "some mode of presentation" under which Pierre believes London is pretty. Well, given any and all modes of presentation, does Pierre believe London is pretty? Can we ask this latter question? Is the former statement even usual for ascribing beliefs. We want to know the content of Pierre's belief, but we are told that <em>it's possible</em> that he believes London is pretty. We are not told exactly which mode of presentation, but that <em>there is</em> a mode of presentation. We could seek out that mode of presentation; we could ask of Pierre under which circumstances he came to believe that London is pretty. He may forget. What will we say, then? That Pierre believes London is pretty but the mode of presentation which gave us our evidence to support an existential generalization is now missing.]]></content:encoded>

The antecedent conditions for these utterances are different.

The structures of marking, sign, symbol, sequence, variables bring me no avail unless I study them more rigorously, but already I feel the pre-theoretical conditions to which this Language "practices" its will are conditions which cannot possibly be so controlled and wrangled to the extent I misleadingly suggest to myself. Presuppositions abound as to the nature of symbol insofar as its capacity to enforce this or that ideological proposition. To which proposition are we indebted <em>now</em>? I can hardly shape a semantico-metaphysical monster to which I am in opposition anymore. It seems the hard-won dollar is our biggest enemy, and to no sentience am I aware to scrounge up the demon behind that desire for the profit motive. The profit motive appears, as far as I can see, appears to be just that simple: a motive for profit. There is no narrative (grand or otherwise). Where is the evidence for it? I see simple folks engage in simple activities and make simple mistakes. We jump quickly to the curious, "big" mistakes as if they hunt down big numbers ($700 billion).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The broadest split in ethical theories assumes that moral statements or propositions are to be viewed as either cognitive or noncognitive. A cognitive statement is that kind of statement which is said to be, in the least, meaningful or to be, in a stricter and empirical sense, subject to truth-functionality. In this way, moral propositions are thought to be synthetic propositions. Analytic truths are by no means about the world in the way a moral claim is purported to be about the world. Indeed, given the nature of analytic truths, it would be plain to all of their truth, if any one of them happens to be true, but it is quite difficult, I think, for anyone to produce a non-trivial moral claim that is accepted by every rational being. We shall touch on the trivial versus the non-trivial moral proposition, or claim, later, as it will be important to see that “trivial moral propositions” are indeed nothing more than analytic statements. Therefore, they should be treated as such, despite the belief of the speaker so uttering that (trivial) moral proposition.
But back to our dichotomy between the cognitively meaningful and the noncognitive. A meaningful statement is that kind of statement which either (1) is thinkable within the cognitive framework of a rational agent or (2) expresses a proposition. Naturally, the noncognitivist must then hold negative views with respect to the cognitivist about moral propositions (or moral language). The noncognitivist will hold that a moral proposition either (1a) is not thinkable within the cognitive framework of a rational agent or (2a) does not express a proposition. Of course, we now have to ask the questions: What does it mean to be thinkable? What is, if anything, a proposition, let alone a moral one?
“Thinking,” in this sense, refers to that capacity to entertain a thought, a faculty which a rational agent must possess. Examples are usually given to disclose what is and what is not thinkable. Surely, the proposition which states that (1) the shoe is inside the box is thinkable. To consider it, one merely needs to conceive (or imagine), roughly, a shoe and a box, to understand the preposition (which presupposes an understanding of spatial relation), the copula, the article used twice. The whole of the sentence is thinkable without much effort. But further, given that moral statements are thought to be subject to truth-functionality, we should use this example to highlight just what that means. Without question, it will be true of the situation so described if the shoe is in fact inside the box. If the shoe is not inside the box, then, accordingly, the claim that it is will be deemed false. (1) is a synthetic proposition, of course, because nowhere therein the definition of the terms so used will one find the presence of a contrasting term (found within the sentence). Like so, one will not discover that “shoe,” insofar as its definition goes, involves “boxes” or grammatical constructs. Now, the question is: Do moral propositions, if cognitive, resemble the outline of meaningfulness and truth-functionality that I have just given?
Meaningfulness, so far as the charged is raised against the logical positivist, is a multifaceted term. It is as amorphous as, perhaps, poetry. As a concept, it is subject to the whims of the language-game. It is claimed that though I have rambled on about synthetic-this and truth-that, I, and any alike in my thinking, will be forever subject to the whirlpool of equivocality. When I lasso “meaning” down to a set of principles or statements, I have somehow pushed aside the tongues of common folk as illiterate and daft. Or, as a lesser criticism, I have simply ignored the “true essence” of the concept. Meaning is often, in this “true” sense, taken to mean something like “purpose” or has more to do with the agenda of the existentialists. Perhaps all that I have said in no way undermines their doctrine. But surely “meaning” must be grounded, whether it be “science” or the latest cultural trend is no concern of mine My project simply is to spell out the logical structure of the term so given and how it applies to ethical theories. If one thinks, then, that “meaning” is a forever unattainable linguistic object, lost to us except in our non-linguistic maneuvers, then my only possible counter, I think, could be to cry defeatism or to perhaps ask How is it that you now dictate the “true essence” of the term? Because surely if my opponent wishes to persuade me, this person will indeed need to put words to the definition of meaningful. But if “meaning” is something we do rather than say, then clearly my opponent has cast the term out of discourse. And I fail to imagine any argument that might be justified in leaning to this semantic vacuum.
I render this caveat for a more personal purpose. I think an implicit psychological tendency we as human beings bears is to make this distinction between doing and saying. We may look back, as it were, at our behavior or response with respect to a proposition, then consider it natural to assume that the proposition itself is prima facie meaningful and thus not in need of a skeptical attitude. This occurs with respect to the majority of the propositions we encounter in daily living. It makes natural to consider God does so-and-so and the shoe is in the box as residing on the same logical foundations. However, the latter presupposes much less than the former. What follows is that we act on basis of both propositions, though they undoubtedly bear different logical infrastructures, in such a way that affirms their meaningfulness. We carry on in reacting to the proposition as if it were a meaningful one, satisfying the thinkability criterion and the truth-functional criterion. But surely, as many religious persons must admit, thought does not always follow claims about God’s going-ons. What usually transpires is an easy acceptance of that statement so uttered which involves the term “God” so to move along within the talk exchange or conversation. Indeed, in our daily linguistic moves, we “get” the “meaning” before or almost at the same time our pundit, preacher or patron does. In effect, behaving in a certain way gives one the illusion that what one has been dealt linguistically must have been meaningful in the sense I have outlined. But surely acting first and “remembering” the cognitive nature, if any, of a proposition does not entail that the proposition was in fact cognitive. Of course, many statements made in the context of errands and religious ceremony presuppose an array of implicit knowledge. Naturally, if one is religious and she stumbles into an atheist, a sort of grounding is demanded, namely a grounding, or equalization, of knowledge. To be more explicit: the atheist and the noncognitivist will be wary of special pleading.
Most, if not all, propositions presuppose some background of knowledge, a set of thinkable and perhaps more basic truths about the world. That some of us have access to this knowledge is no guarantee for the truth-functional aspect of the moral proposition. At this point, we can see that I admit the sort of willy-nilly “meaning” the existentialist argues for. We can all carry on as if we have understood what we have just been told, and the teller, of course, will likely interpret our action, so long as it is more or less positive and congenial with respect to her general “meaning” (regardless of the literal function of the sentence or set of sentences and their entailments), in such a way that affirms to her that her propositions we “in fact” meaningful. But, as said, this aspect of meaning perhaps crudely satisfies the concept of meaningfulness to which I and the logical positivist spirit accept. I need not argue it too much because, nevertheless, truth is not at all brought into the picture of acting and speaking. Implicature is prevalent in this domain of “meaning” and approximate interpretations govern the discourse. And perhaps this is all the meaning there is to be had: meaning as use within a language game. But now we must ask, where does “truth” enter? Truth surely plays a significant role in (1), but what of the class of purported “moral propositions”? Unless this question is addressed, I can feel only a creeping nihilism, as I too often do, about the basis of all rationality. With this “meaning as use” notion, perhaps one can easily picture the world as a deterministic system of cause and effect, fully describable in mechanistic terms. Perhaps I step too boldly to equate nihilism and determinism… And this is easy to do, given that determinism itself is not a theory about the world. But enough of this digression.
We have, with hope, touched more than enough on meaning. Now, we may touch on truth. It has been contended by the verificationists that propositions ought to be considered true, and thus meaningful, if and only if it is reducible to some experience which may verify it. The weaker verificationist line of thought took a proposition to be meaningful if and only if it was possible to translate that proposition into some experience or set of experiences, so as to verify it. The former demands that a proposition fit into the scheme of experiential understanding while the latter demands that a proposition fit into the scheme of potential, possible or future experiential understanding. To be able at all to verify a proposition, for the latter, implies its meaningfulness. Verification involves the concept of truth-functionality. What the verificationist uses as a standard for determining truth-value (the true or the false) is the definitional and the observational. A proposition may be true by definition or true if it corresponds to some observed event. (For me, events involve the objects. The objects themselves are irrelevant. They only make sense in terms of the event, which is the key object of science and observation.) With this said, we see that the shoe and the box are really meaningless terms on their own. The proposition is a claim about an event, namely the shoe and the box being related in such-and-such a way. I apply this line of thinking to subject-predicate or function-argument systems as well. “Susan is X” is a proposition that claims something about an event, namely an event which involves the subject, argument, object, whatever, “Susan” and the speaker’s understanding of the concept “X”. The proposition is true if the event is satisfied in the way intended by the speaker. Intentionality can be set aside for later. To say the least about intentionality, the way I use “intend” in this example involves something like “within an ascertainable context of time.” What might occupy “X” in this case will always shift the intentionality of the speaker, so as to make the concept “fit.” Surely, if “X” is satisfied with “happy,” it would be a stretch for us to believe that the speaker is claiming that Susan is happy all the time, indeterminately, etc. But we need not go too far into this. I surmise that this is already sufficiently understood that concepts presuppose more basic constraints or context in general.
At this point, it seems fitting to introduce the noncognitivist.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've got a new pseudo-philosophical pastime. Let's call it <strong>Anthropocentric Metaphor</strong>! Yea! The rules follow as the name suggests, and you may already be playing it as you live at this very moment! But let's be more forthcoming in our play.

Think of your own (1) reason for or (2) explanation of:

(a) The beginning of the Universe or
(b) The nature of God and other like deities

without appealing to anthropcentrism or lost metaphor. Once you do, you've lost!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Epictetus</strong>

Law of Power
Minor Premise - There exist free things in nature.
Minor Premise - There exist bounded things in nature.
Major Assumption - There are two aspects to nature: a free aspect and a bounded aspect. This would be a argument for duality in nature. It is an assignment of natures to potential ontological objects; either an objects status is free or it is unfree. There can be no middle ground. The assumption is that nature expresses itself in two distinguishable ways.

<strong>1</strong> "The things that are up to us are by nature free, unhindered, and unimpeded; the things that are not up to us are weak, enslaved, hindered, not our own."

Defined here is a Law of Power which distinguishes not what specifically is free and is not free in the world, but the duality between what could be free and those opposite entities in reality. Epictetus sets at odds all things at the outset by their ontological status in so far as freedom, but not the potential for freedom. Anything which is not free, for Epictetus, is enslaved in principle and forever subject to the whims and power of another, whatever that other power may be. The chains of impedance never unshackle from things which are "not ones own." The underlining assumption here is that theoretically there is at least one entity or thing in the world which is free to which this principle of freedom applies.

<strong>2</strong> "And if it is about one of the things that is not up to us, be ready to say, "You are nothing in relation to me."

It is believed that all things flowing within the domain of the enslaved and definitely determined exist outside of us in a sense unrelated to ourselves. But keep in mind that this is a method to achieve complacency and comfort when you find yourself at odds with the external world. Why should the same principle not apply to harmonious and agreeable things? We'll get to that.

He applies this principle of aversion by proposing that we be averse only to those things that are abhorred by nature or the nature of things. However, we must presuppose first that the nature of a thing involves aversion of certain other things. How can we justify this? Furthermore, the principle of aversion describes relationships that are inherently negative between entities, but how do we explain this that are beneficial to the achievement of desired things? At what point does a desire for a thing become an innate property of any entity? Is the faculty of desire defined by the things which are desired or is it defined by the principle capability to desire? (a) If the former, then aversion and benefit are just as arbitrary as the things desired, for they are for which we desire--but aside from being unable to truly determine their benefit--they are outside of us, outside of being "up to us." Things desired at not significant because we desire them; they must be significant for some other reason, if we wish to follow this principle of determinism. We do not freely choose what we are averse to or what we enjoy or find benefit from. (b) If the latter, then we must explain how this faculty of desiring is justified: Are those things which we desire beneficial and Good merely because we desire them? It remains to be explained how this faculty of desire relates to external entities. Their ontological relation to our desire, is the meat of the problem.]]></content:encoded>

"I adhere to the Socratic vision that philosophy should be premised on an encounter, preferably in public spaces, involving exchange and dialogue, and hopefully in such a way as to irritate the priests and the statesmen. Following Spinoza, Deleuze, and Badiou, I agree that the dream of philosophy since its inception with Thales is immanence, or the idea that we need not refer beyond the world or to special authorities to explain what is and value, and with Socrates that what matters is what is said, not who says it. Philosophical claims are claims that should be addressed to all, regardless of identity, nation, gender, religion, etc., or should be truly kosmopolitan claims premised on a subject that is void of its identifications. Following Lucretius, I hold that philosophy seeks to escape superstition and ideology. Philosophy seeks the conceptual technologies through discourse which might complete this dream. " - Sinthome

1.3 Intuition cannot describe the state of feeling of a human being because the intuition is not inferred by any object so observed.

		<title>Biography &amp; Works by Benedict (Bento; Baruch) de Spinoza</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Biography</strong>
Bento Spinoza was a child of the Dutch Enlightenment, also referred to as the Dutch Republic's "Golden Age." I refer to it as the Dutch <em>Enlightenment</em> because Amsterdam, rolling into the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, as a European body, highlighted the origins & economic & intellectual flourishing of the larger European Enlightenment of the eighteenth-century. Thinkers such as Descartes and Spinoza, though members of what philosophers academically dub the "Age of Reason", champion the foundational ideology of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Indeed, they were the framers of said ideology, fostering for subsequent thinkers a systematized, rationalistic approach to the sciences and substantial argumentation for religious freedom, among other notable achievements. But I digress.

"Bento", as his family called him, went by "Baruch" when speaking with elder Rabbis & fellow classmates at Hebrew school & synagogue, & sported "Benedict", following his <em>cherem</em>, or writ of excommunication, as he romped with the intellectual Christians of the day. He was around 24 at the day of castration of his Jewish credibility. To his community, he had become an invalid, if not despised & distrusted. But what exactly had he done to warrant such a punishment? The most likely explanation his immediate & later biographers can infer consists of his generally disturbing utterances of "abominable heresies" and "heretical deeds." More specifically, as it has been noted by [bluh], he pronounced doctrines which denied immortality of the soul, the existence of angels, and asserted the corporeality of the divine nature, i.e. God. Whatever it was exactly, Spinoza found what can be easily described as <em>relief</em>. As his blasphemous utterances actualized his separation from Jewish orthodoxy with official & public notoriety, his response to the hearing of his banishment was, humorously, his own absence. He had no qualms with the results of his actions, and he was out the door of his Jewish community without note.

...
<strong>On the Improvement of the Understanding; 1662 (unfinished)</strong>
...
<strong>Principles of Cartesian Philosophy with Metaphysical Thoughts; 1663</strong>
Along with being an ecclesiastic authority on Hebrew & Christian history, theology, & culture, Spinoza was an acknowledged & well-respected expositor of Cartesian philosophy. Arguably so, his strength of adherence to Cartesian principles was greater and more consistent than Decartes' himself.

		<title>I Got Aristotle&#039;d &amp; the Rules of Reasoning</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/?p=159</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know how it goes; it went that way throughout the entire Scholastic heyday. <em>Aristotle Says</em> arguments were possibly the most ubiquitous quasi de jure arguments which surmounted any possibility of intellectual heterodoxy. 
<blockquote><strong>Peripatetic</strong>: "<em>Aristotle Says</em>: The Earth is the center of the Universe."
<strong>Galileo</strong>: "That's an appeal to authority; furthermore, did he even perform the experiments which lead him to that conclusion? Did you? Your logical fallacies are maddening!"
<strong>Peripatetic</strong>: "Well, Aristotle invented logic, so: <em>Aristotle Says</em>!"</blockquote>
This sums up about the climate of the Medieval Philosophic period in so far as "novel" thought is concerned; very slow to change.

<strong>Principium Identitatis</strong>
That is, the <em>Law of Identit</em>y, commonly & mistakenly attributed to Aristotle, may have been explicitly invented during the Middle Ages or much, much later.<sup>1</sup> Anyway, I've been carrying on (philosophizing) with the belief that Aristotle actually introduced the Law of Identity. The law states that a thing:

(1) is the totality of itself;
(2) is the same as itself;
(3) involves itself;
(4) is <em>in itself</em> or <em>of itself</em>;
(5) entails <em>itself</em> (which I take to mean it logically is equivalent to itself);
(6) is a proposition that is equivalent to that exact same proposition;

There are many ways of interpreting the law, and its interpretations do convey a different meaning, depending on the context of the presented argument. Briefly and symbolically, it states:

(7) A &equiv; A
(8) A &there4; A (that is, assume A; therefore, A, or A follows from A)

<strong>Prove It!</strong>
Well, here's one way:
1 A (premise)
2 -A (<acronym title="Provisional Assumption">prov. assum.</acronym>)
3 A&-A (1,2 <acronym title="Conjunction Introduction">conj. intro.</acronym>)
4 A (2-3 <acronym title="Reductio Ad Absurdum">raa</acronym>)

Another way:
1 A (premise)
2 A (<acronym title="Provisional Assumption">prov. assum.</acronym>)
3 A (1 <acronym title="Reiteration">reit</acronym>)
4 A &sup; A (2-3 <acronym title="Conditional Proof">cond. proof</acronym>)
5 A (4,1 modus ponens)

<strong>Thoughts</strong>
What this means is that if you do in fact <em>have</em> a thing, i.e. that it is <em>true</em>; its truth-value assignment is "true"; it is empirically verified; it <em>cannot</em> be "false", the negation of that thing will lead to a contradiction or an absurdity. For instance, you do <em>in fact</em> have a cat that is orange. The negation of the proposition "I have an orange cat" will inevitably lead to a contradiction because, well, something had to leave orange fur on your sofa! Or, more strictly, as the previous case could be attributed to the likelihood that an orange dog broke into your home, you are now holding an orange cat in your arms. So the law of identity is strict, and as its scope for individuals, the law pertains only to the individual. It holds as a proposition which only has say about itself, and contrary evidence does not infiltrate the logical form of the concept or thing involved. The logical form of the individual does not involve evidence outside of it; if it did, then that evidence would in fact no be contrary to the logical form of the individual unless that contrary evidence shared the same nature to that which it is contrary to. An orange cat cannot have the color-property of green and orange; there could be a blend between the two, but then, you would have to admit that the cat was never orange. It was another color. Properties have contrary natures lead to gradations of their contrasts to produce a new property which, in fact, is an actual property of the thing in question.

<strong>Law of Noncontradiction</strong>
Introduced by Aristotle, the popular statement of the law reads,
<blockquote>It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.
&mdash;<em>Metaphysics</em> IV 3 1005b19–20; Aristotle</blockquote>
This statement applies to the "ontological" form. There are a total of three forms which were expressed by Aristotle. The three forms are listed as follows.
(1) <strong>Ontological</strong> &mdash; Stated above.
(2) <strong>Doxastic</strong> &mdash; "It is impossible to hold (suppose) the same thing to be and not to be" (<em> Metaphysics</em> IV 3 1005b24 cf.1005b29–30).
(3) <strong>Semantic</strong> &mdash; "opposite assertions cannot be true at the same time" (<em> Metaphysics</em> IV 6 1011b13–20).

D1: By <em>contradictory propositions</em>, I understand a pair of propositions which cannot both be true, and cannot both be false; e.g. "I am drinking water" & "I am not drinking water". That is, the truth of both propositions, for the subject ("I"), cannot co-exist. Further, the propositions "[It is false that] I am drinking water" & "[It is false that] I am not drinking water" cannot co-exist; the latter claims that I am drinking water while the former claims that I am not.

D2: By <em>contrary propositions</em>, I understand a pair of propositions which cannot both be true, but can both be false; e.g. "That cat is orange" & "That (same) cat is blue" cannot both be true. But, as said, the latter stipulation of the definition maintains because the cat very well could be pink (to me).

D3: By <em>subcontrary propositions</em>, I understand a pair of propositions which cannot both be false, but can both be true; e.g. "That person is male" & "That (same) person is female" cannot both be false together. The person must have a "gender"; so, we could say the person is transgender. Do subcontraries <em>force</em> linguistic invention?

<strong>Law of the Excluded Middle</strong>

<strong>Law of Bivalence</strong>

List the laws of thought!

Infinity!

		<title>A Normative Theory of Power</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1</strong> The object of any normative theory in ethics is the attainment of a universal code whereby all persons, whatever their intellectual constitution, can live by without committing harm&mdash;mental or physical, intentional or not&mdash;to constituents living within the same social context. An always looming question: What is the context?

<strong>2</strong> An apparent problem with producing a normative theory is keeping sight of the future and that of calculating the scope of responsibility. The unapparent solution begins at basing our normative ethical claims upon what we understand of human psychology and neuroscience. 

<strong>3</strong> Beginning at the observation of "ends" of nature, where humanity is but an ontological constituent, is nothing but a pursuit for chimaeras, which I cannot consent to existing anywhere but in the consciousness lag of the human psyche. This <em>lag</em> exists with respect to our instructed edifying principles which we cannot help but feel that they stand firmly and resolutely in the safety of our memory. Whether they are there or not is not my concern with this point, but it is our natural consciousness of them.

<strong>4</strong> Our actions move us to those "ends" we perceive, and we attempt to rationalize them, nevertheless, as absolutely following harmoniously from the statues of our well-constructed intellects. But truly, I declare, we could not be further than the truth of the matter of perceiving ourselves as acting in the ways in which we prescribe through written document and pen. 

<strong>5</strong> How far are we from acting in accordance with our "mental statues"; and how close to we come to engaging in whatever discourse as intellectuals coursing the world atop savage, inhumane beasts. 

<strong>6</strong> Human nature, as if it were two words not signifying one meaning, becomes internally detached and inconstant: the scapegoat for our flaws becomes nature, and the humanity we praise becomes king. We become the students of the academic tradition that studies humans <em>in</em> nature rather than humans <em>as</em> nature. 

<strong>7</strong> The primary truth is that what we know best of nature must necessarily be factored into how we claim be must necessarily be "human." Systems of morality which feign to establish truths notwithstanding close inspection of the constitution of humanity qua nature&mdash;without explaining humanity as such from that humble root&mdash;I say must be burned, books dashed and smashed to the ground. What use have we for the "virtues" of the Peripatetics or the alien duties of the deontologists? And the "goods" of the ulilitarians are, as said, nothing but fictions which cannot exist in nature. Pragmatists gather 'round and do not give us the illusion of right by statistics, as if statistical understanding were not the determinant of the cause of those very statistics you claim to have weight. And who but us will understand the cause of movement? Who but a human will interpret for this or that political party or end? You, pragmatists and utilitarians, have paraded in <em>circles</em> around your conclusions, never establishing anything but truisms which help no one.

<strong>8</strong> The theory begins with nature; and humanity's presence and prescription cannot be explained by any means except through humanity's congruity and concordance with nature.]]></content:encoded>

1. What is the dream argument?
1.1 Resemblance thesis (conjoined with 1.2)
But I cannot forget that, at other times I have been deceived in sleep by similar illusions; and, attentively considering those cases, I perceive so clearly that there exist no certain marks by which the state of waking can ever be distinguished from sleep, that I feel greatly astonished; and in amazement I almost persuade myself that I am now dreaming.

1.11 Impossible doubts (step to hyperbolic doubt)
[…] there are yet many other of their informations (presentations), of the truth of which it is manifestly impossible to doubt; as for example, that I am in this place, seated by the fire, clothed in a winter dressing gown, that I hold in my hands this piece of paper, with other intimations of the same nature.

	“But how could I deny that I possess these hands and this body…”?
1.2 Supposition that I am dreaming
2. How was the dream argument raised?
3. Did Descartes build a sufficient foundation to support the dream argument?
4. The scraps of Moore’s arguments
5 My own arguments (Wittgensteinian)
6 Weakness of the Evidence for the Skeptical Hypothesis (Fallacy of Composition)
7 Is (a) knowledge(-claim) a property of an individual mind?

		<title>Critiques of Utilitarianism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Utilitarianism</strong>
Actions should seek to obtain the greatest good for the greatest number. Immediately we can ask, "Well, who decides the 'goods'?" Of course, what is most pleasing to the greatest number is the answer. So the prediction of consequences must assume within its theoretical endeavor that peoples' opinions inasmuch as the 'good' is sufficiently understood.

Premises: goods are calculable

<strong>Critiques</strong>
The criterion for applying a utilitarian outlook cannot itself be utilitarian unless all competing theories are shown not to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. Further, utilitarian calculus cannot sufficiently judge the greatest good of non-calculable qualities of lesser or greater potential.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 That the opinion is ubiquitous in communicative discourse is a question of little interest. Our object should not be to found a method by which the special locations in dialogue where the opinion might manifest can be more easily exposed. Thus, a practical assumption for our purposes will be that the opinion, whatever it may be, is present everywhere linguistically, first, and semantically second. However, the common preconceptions that haunt the opinion's ontological nature will be of interest to us, so as to strip it of unclarity and that we might view it essentially. That said, we might even question whether there is an ontological nature to such a concept as the opinion, and this will be one of our main objects: to find the "use" of the opinion in linguistic discourse and to determine sufficiently if the opinion extends beyond the struggle between meanings.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Philosophy and Suicide</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Universe exists; its antithesis is to not exist. Humans exist; their antithesis is death or to not exist. If free will were to be a reality, the only way it can be proven as such is for someone who debates the philosophical question of suicide to commit suicide purely from the argument. Because the only thing the Universe cannot do is cease to exist. Thus, for a person to have free will is to prove that non-existence is more valuable than existence. Which is to say, only a person can do what the Universe cannot. Thus, the only way to prove free will exists is to commit suicide. And the only "free" action that can be made is to end one's own existence.

"We will never find the truth."

And that is the whole point why the tradition of philosophy exists. To find the answer. When you say what you say; when anyone says, "there will never be an answer." It is a kind of awkward euphemism, that. Because it itself tries to pass off as a perverted answer which assumes exactly what is trying to be found [or is to never be found]. What is the concept of Truth being independent of the awareness of itself? Why would Truth be concealed from itself? Suicide necessarily and boldly brings truth to itself, "Be confronted by only that which can tame you." The answer is either within Truth or outside of it; but to claim that it is outside of it is to claim that Truth is dependent and not subsistent by its own means. There is an answer, but the quest is to found out whether it is existence or non-existence. We have to approach it as existing, because we do exist. In light of that,--and since non-existence isn't even a possible method or avenue to determine its truth--, we must necessarily find all the peculiarities of the path we seem necessitated to take.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To confront Spinozism, if one is consistently attentive to the plurality of opposing notions which afflict everyone's life in some form or another, is to, as Nietzsche put it with haunting succinctness, "gaze into the abyss." 

Yet while those who shudder at the mere thought of an abyss, they find themselves easily falling prey to illusory happiness, never to truly face not their fear but their inadequacy. A far more disconcerting notion, for it humbles.

Following are those more reasoned—the championed atheistic—grounded by rationality but fickle by empiricism. To them, the abyss is there, but they bold it with nigh ignorance and courage—it is this courage that is produced by comparison of one's self to the strength of the gaze of the abyss. It must be assumed, quite foolishly, I feel, that there can even be what one may call a reaction from the abyss itself. In a certain and disturbing way, what must be realized is that the abyss is but a mirror, reflecting your empowered and burning gaze as a chilling and infinitely distant nothing.

How could Nietzsche come to such a conclusion if not for his understanding and confrontation of Spinoza's God--the God of the Abyss. Spinoza's God, in short, is the abyss itself.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>&quot;A Theologico-Political Treatise&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Spinoza's Scriptural interpretation moves and inspires me! I will share some passages from his originally illicit yet seminal work of Biblical criticism, <em>A Theologico-Political Treatise.</em>

<strong>On Obedience as Faith</strong>
<blockquote>[...] it follows that they are the true enemies of Christ who persecute honourable and justice-loving men because they differ from them, and do not uphold the same religious dogmas as themselves: for whosoever loves justice and charity we know, by that very fact, to be faithful: whosoever persecutes the faithful, is an enemy of Christ.
[<em>Definitions of Faith</em>; Elwes, pp. 185]</blockquote>

<em>Scriptural Basis: First John 2</em>
3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

<em>What I Take</em>
Briefly, you know how liberal Christians today argue Christianity as "progressive" and generally good based on works of the religious constituency. Well, if this argument is to hold, the faith itself is obedience to producing good works. Spinoza argues "For obedience implies faith, and faith without works is dead" which is based on the Scripture. 

<strong>On Contradiction</strong>
So you say the Bible has no contradiction. Well, under Spinoza's overarching thesis, that the Bible teaches (its sole purpose is to teach) obedience and faith and not reason and philosophy, it would be difficult not to find contradiction between the multitude of different authors (coming from different eras and cultures)! This contradiction is found in First Samuel against Jeremiah, both of which assume something of God which is, outside of the contradiction, nevertheless, unreasonable to suggest as pertaining to God or Nature.

<em>First Samuel 15:</em>
29 The Glory of Israel neither retracts nor repents, for he is not man that he should repent.

<em>Jeremiah 18:</em>
8 But if that nation which I have threatened turns from its evil, I also repent of the evil which I threatened to do.
9 Sometimes, again, I promise to build up and plant a nation or a kingdom.
10 But if that nation does what is evil in my eyes, refusing to obey my voice, I repent of the good with which I promised to bless it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stand down, sir! I do not feel our relationship as sufficiently matured to a point that would necessitate a discussion of my philosophical views proper. And of my faith, what has that to do with the aforementioned when it is by my works and deeds that I ought to be judged, and not by my ability to quibble over the nature of the absolutely infinite. It is the philosophers who contemplate divine things keenly and with much understanding while it is the theologian who speaks cleverly. But even those philosophers, the most learned of minds, can be found degrading the most esteemed faculty of humanity—the mind—with triviality and pettiness drenched in frustration and feuding. Of two non-philosophers such as ourselves sharing words of divine things,—not even in my nightmares could there be conjured a more harmful notion to the well-being of mankind.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 Society A will say, "For this avenue or discourse, this is its good!"; Society Z will say, "For this avenue or discourse, this is its good!"
1.1 If the goods of either avenue or discourse of that society conflict, then they will enter into dialogue concerning those goods.
1.11 Dialogue can attempt to 
2 People within A or B will tell themselves that good of an avenue or discourse is a legitimate good. For example, a coffee franchise, considered by those in A, produces a legitimate good. Why do they tell themselves this? Some will say it is not. Those who disagree with the legitimacy of that good will dissent. Should they do so, what is their alternative? Either repair the illegitimate good or replace the illegitimate good. If the people in support of that good see the good as a legitimate good, they will not observe re-structuring of that good.
3 If a dissenter says, "The quality of your good is poor because of its production or origin" but those in support of the perceived illegitimate good themselves perceive it as having great quality (the good as a result, not as a process), then the replacement of the good is not possible. How does the perceived illegitimate good reach a status of legitimacy and maintain it? Is it the good itself or the perception of it?
4 If the masses are persuaded that its resultant good is of great quality but its process is poor quality, what determines how they will make these observations with a certain prevalence. If the process does not satisfy them but the good itself does, why should they care for the process's quality?
5 If a poor process and an exceptional process can, in so far as the public perceives it, produce an acceptable good, then why should any person choose one process over the other? Can the claim "I only appreciate my products for how they satisfy me" justify any argument against the process of the good which satisfies.
6 Someone can both criticize the process and the good itself, but one cannot criticize a good in so far as someone appreciates it as a specific kind of pleasure through appeal to its process. If a good pleases someone, then how it came to be is of no importance.
7 A defense against the criticism of the process of product A cannot be, "but look how many people are pleased by it!" For instance, foot traffic does not legitimize the process, only the good itself as a result to a social context.
8 Ethos of a social context dictates what products are legitimate goods. There are agreed upon goods.
9 If someone in a social context is not aware of the process of products but appreciates their results, then that person must determine the good of her product's process in order to argue that it is better than the...
10 But social coercion occurs. Some common ideas are simply passed to one another, most only based on results and the presumed desire to those results, not interested in their processes.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Notes:</em>

[<strong>2:04PM, January 30, 2008</strong>] Proposition 8:
Spinoza describes in detail the Principle of Sufficient Reason in so far as the cause of individual things. The definition of a thing does not assert or explain in any way the number of individual things that bear the definition. The definition only describes the nature of that thing. The number of individual things will have to be grasped through some other means than those things definition or essential nature. Furthermore, he establishes a Principle of Causality which demands that the cause of a thing in Nature must be outside of that thing. We can get to the controversial issue of why this Principle as such does not apply to Nature itself. In a word, Spinoza has formulated a dichotomy, as expressed through A1 and A2. It must be noted that any elucidation of the cause of Substances does not apply to the cause of Modes in so far as the Principle of Causality. Thus, the true issue is: Why two Principles of Causality; and furthermore, how does Spinoza make these two Principles (for Substances and subsequently for Modes) concordant.]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>Instrumental duo acoustic guitar/drums from Bordeaux, France born in November 1998. Cheval de Frise's music unites a melodic approach with binary system. Cheval de Frise gets its own language and their unique music reminding us of Gastr Del Sol, Don Caballero and Ruins directions, intersections, juxtapositions, superpostions. Cheval de Frise runs in the same way as ivy on stone.

<blockquote>65daysofstatic are an instrumental post-rock band from Sheffield, England. [...] The band intersperses heavy, progressive, guitar-driven instrumental sections with live drums and off-beat sampled drums akin to those of Aphex Twin. Their albums, as a result, maintain a distinctively gritty, almost industrial feel.

Actarus's self-titled has a clean sound which fluctuates between post-rock and math rock - and no, not the kind math rock we know and love from old greats like Polvo. Their music is in the same vein as just about every other contemporary post-rock band; it's that kind of "math rock" that actually means "progressive." But nonetheless, their guitars are playful with all-around favorite start/stop dynamics, and their tempo is more allegro moderato with drifts into soft, melodic adventures while chanting along the way. It's unfortunate that they broke up only after releasing this EP and a split.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Chapter 1 : Of Prophecy</strong>
<strong>1</strong> "Prophecy, or revelation, is sure knowledge revealed by God to man. A prophet is one who interprets the revelations of God to those who are unable to attain to sure knowledge of the matters revealed, and therefore can only apprehend them by simple faith." [pg. 12 Unabridged Elwes Translation]
<strong>1.1</strong> Spinoza argued that only Moses achieved physical (through the senses) communication with God; however, that communication was through the imagination.
<strong>1.2</strong> He taught us that "nabi" means "speaker" or "interpreter", and argued that Aaron, Moses' older brother, was the "nabi"; thus, he received the title as "prophet", as an interpreter of God is a prophet when looking at Scripture. When Moses spoke to Pharoah, Aaron interpreted, acting as the "prophet."
<blockquote>"See [Moses], I have made thee a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet;"</blockquote>
<strong>1.3</strong> Prophecy involves ordinary knowledge, like scientific or mundane sorts of knowledge.
<strong>1.4</strong> Prophets had natural bodies and natural minds; they could not have had ontologically different minds or spirits. It would be ad hoc to claim they do in order to prove they spoke anything but ordinary knowledge.
<strong>1.5</strong> Prophets are bound by Nature but can have Divine insight because the Nature of God emanates through all minds and bodies.
<strong>1.6</strong> The Law of Moses nowhere describes God as "without body" or "without form"; for God must have had some sort of form in order for Moses to distinguish it. Either in Moses' dreams or in some physical sense. [pg. 17]
<strong>1.7</strong> God speaks through "appearances and signs"
<strong>1.8</strong> No other prophet except Jesus received revelation without use of imagination, which all other prophets used.
<strong>1.9</strong> "ruagh" is commonly translated to "spirit" but it literally means "a wind", or a kind of wind.
<strong>1.91</strong> It translates to many things under many contexts; courage, virtue, etc.
<blockquote>If the Jews were at a loss to understand any phenomenon, or were ignorant of its causes, they referred it to God.
[TPT pg._ _]</blockquote>
<strong>1.92</strong> Wind of God; storm = chiding of God; "Eolus" = Greek wind-god

<strong>2</strong> Spinoza taught that phrases such as "Spirit of the Lord" and references to God in the most trivial sense were never meant to be supernatural. For instance,

<blockquote>16:14 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
16:15 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
16:16 Let our lord now command thy servants, <em>which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp</em>: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, <em>and thou shalt be well.</em>
<strong>&mdash;1 Samuel 15-16</strong></blockquote>

The passage suggest that a natural thing such as music can attenuate a supposedly supernatural ailment.
(1) If God is supernatural, then God's affects require supernatural counterbalances.
(2) Saul was not balanced (set well) by a supernatural counterbalance.
(3) Therefore, God is not supernatural (God is natural).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By substance I understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself; that is, that which does not require the concept of another thing from which it must be formed.

That thing is said to be finite in its own kind which can be limited by another of the same nature.

By attribute I understand what the mind perceives of a substance as constituting its nature.

By mode I understand the affection, or modifications, of a substance; that is, that which is either in itself or in other, from which it constitutes the extended substances form in a various many ways.

By God I understand a being absolutely infinite; that is, a being consisting of an infinity of attributes, each of which expressing God's infinite and eternal essence.

		<title>Aristotle on Virtue</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Aristotle argues from observation of the functions of properties of the human being; properties such as “is a flutist” and “is a sports player” are presumed to have internal purposes within those properties so as to permit the observational “ends”, which allow for the observer to judge the quality of those properties. His argument hinges on the presumed ontological similarity of “human being” and, say, “flutist”; however, these are ontologically disparate entities. However, Aristotle further argues implicitly that, given the lack of “reason” in animals, humans are unique, rational animals. He further presumes that reason has a function, like that of musicians and sports players, and this leads him to conclude that the nature of “human being”, given its “rational” quality, sits in the same ontologically category as “musician.” This is an apparent category mistake; all Aristotle has done is explain what is good for a property of “human being”, and that property would be “is a rationalist”, say. The dilemma is still present: What is good for a human being? By Aristotle’s analogical argument, what have been compared are properties of “human being”. Simply because a human being exhibits that quality, it does not make it so that the quality is what all human beings must strive for. Furthermore, Aristotle stations himself within consequentialist framework in so far as he appeals to the “ends” of rationality—he sees a certain aesthetic to what rationality can produce as an end. If he is attempting to argue for supposed “virtues”, their conception cannot be based on the observation of utility of those presupposed virtues. If he does not appeal to ends, then he must be seeing rationality as a thing-in-itself which is a necessary property to be virtuous. However, virtue does not exist in a vacuum. In order to determine virtue, or good and happy living, the definition is contingent on the absolute reality of other human beings. Would be say that one can be virtuous who lives in solitude? If virtue hinges on observation, then rationality must be judged by its culminations amid observers. We now face again the flirtation with consequentialism. The task Aristotle set out before him was to present a viable option for virtue so as to explain how one could best live their life for a human being; but, as I’ve shown, he appealed to “ends” found in a property of “human being”. He showed that living as actualizing one’s potential as a rational animal is the best life, but, as argued, (a) this can only be judged rightly by appealing to consequences and (b) inevitably leads one to choose this sort of life given one’s fancy. Nevertheless, the nature of “human being” has never entered the picture.

Is Aristotle arguing from the tacit assumption that we have a priori understanding of certain concepts like justice and, for this discussion, virtue? Is he arguing that we intuitively know right and wrong; that we intuitively know contrasting definitions? How can we know that justice is right unless we have experienced or have at least witnessed injustice? If we must necessarily witness justice, then that ascribes virtue to “ends”; what is the constitution of an end? Is it utility? Consequence? How can anyone know they’re being virtuous unless someone tells them so? How can virtue exist discontinuously within the bounds of society or at least amongst observers? The proposition “she is virtuous” depends on a witness; if no witness can observe and make the claim, then she must look within herself to discover what makes her virtuous. Is it even meaningful to ask: Is she virtuous who exists as an utter savage?

Let’s say she lives in society but no one will tell her she’s virtuous. For whatever reason other constituents of society have for doing so, she receives a silent treatment upon any question of her own virtue. Whatever action she takes or discourse she engages in, no one will respond “you’re being a virtuous person.” She knows the concept of virtue exists—she read its definition in the Dictionary—, but how to obtain it is never directly or indirectly ostensively taught to her. Either she will have to determine what constitutes a virtuous action within her own understanding or by observation—that is, she’ll have to connect virtuous action to an innate understanding of virtue, or she will have to appeal to the consequences of her actions within the societal context. If she looks within herself solely, she will either reach perpetual questioning of virtuous action or assert that she is virtuous despite any response she receives. But the question has not been resolved, should the latter be taken as true in her mind. If she appeals to consequences of her actions amongst others, how will she determine, based on observation, that her attempted virtuous actions are in fact virtuous. She may observe that her actions elicit positive responses from others, and they may give her a general understanding of what draws out appealing ends—either by her perceptions or by theirs, more than likely both. Nevertheless, she has only determined what others are pleased by, and this is the definition of virtue which Aristotle wishes to avoid.

Another example might suffice to make this clearer. Taking an object and that object which is taken have, concededly, intrinsically neutral values. The totality of this Value-Fact will either be greater in value or lesser in value than the separate values of those facts, or parts, involved. This Value-Fact, in this case, is neutral. But typically, the totality of this Value-Fact to one person is decidedly negative, or lesser, in value with respect to the independent parts and the sum of those parts when the object taken does not belong to the taker. This aspect of "ownership" must be combined with the Value-Fact previously described. Ownership would declare that the object taken belongs to someone or something by way of explicit claim or natural affinity. A business person owns (is related in this way to) her asserts through claim or, as it may be presumed, effort; a rock owns its--But the Value-Fact of a business person owning their property is positive to them, neutral to disinterested persons, and neutral or negative to persons who wish to take it, but never positive for the latter.

		<title>From the perspective of UI/UX</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This document will serve as the basic recipe which will inform some fancy infographic I plan on cooking up that speaks to developing a process for User Experience, User Interface, Development, Quality Assurance, and Business Teams. As stated in the title, the following discussion, or rather conceptual model/scheme, flows from the perspective of User Interface developers and User Experience designers; as such, the given suggestive conceptual model/scheme may be unwittingly narrowed or limited by their biases and interests.
<h3>Phase 1: Planning</h3>
<h4>Business Team Deliverables</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Use cases</li>
	<li>Business Requirements</li>
	<li>Demo Expectations</li>
	<li>Milestone Planning</li>
</ol>
<h4>User Experience Team Deliverables</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Wireframes</li>
	<li>Creative (Layered PSD)</li>
	<li>Prototypes</li>
	<li>Specifications</li>
</ol>
<h4>User Interface Team Deliverables</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Prototypes
<em>Theoretical: </em>Prototypes do not physically live in the Execution Phase but are used as the basis for Implementation; e.g., SSL/HTML ? JSP; contrast this example with other file types which live in a Web project: CSS, JavaScript, Sprites (Images). The original HTML documents become shared JSP, PHP or ASP documents.</li>
	<li>User Interface Architecture-Specification
Possible topics: <em>Tech stack</em>, <em>Frames </em>(&lt;iframe&gt;?), <em>Integration specification</em>, <em>process detail</em> &amp; <em>limitation detail</em> (between distinct sub-systems; e.g., CMS and custom app integration), <em>File ownership boundaries document</em>, <em>Tech stack dependencies</em> &amp; <em>limitations</em>, <em>AJAX</em>, <em>Implementation details</em> &amp; <em>patterns</em> (between distinct sub-teams; e.g., UI and Java), <em>Cookies</em>, <em>HTML5</em>, <em>design patterns</em>, <em>security</em>, <em>validation patterns</em>, <em>QA guidelines</em>, <em>nomenclature definition</em> &amp; <em>limitations</em></li>
</ol>
<h5>Sub-discussion: What is a wireframe?</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Conceptual</li>
	<li>General</li>
	<li>Low-fidelity (i.e., Black &amp; White)</li>
	<li>Planning Document
<span style="color: #800000;">NOT an Execution Document</span></li>
	<li>Information Architecture/Structural</li>
	<li>Guide to Creative</li>
</ol>
<h5>Sub-discussion: Recommendations: <em>Toward the Ideal</em></h5>
<ol>
	<li>Extend timelines for UX, relative to development teams, to flesh out deliverables.
"<em>More UX up front!</em>"</li>
	<li>Less parallel development</li>
	<li>Never start development without Creative</li>
	<li>Expectations for Demos
Sub-discussion: Demos are part of the Execution Phase, not the Planning Phase. If UI or UX should consider the concept of the "demo," <em>expectations</em> should be defined fundamentally differently from the way they are defined for the Execution Phase. Expectations should not be totally defined in terms of defect considerations. Consider that QA may not be well enough informed to validate Creative itself, since this team may not be versed in its documents. QA's primary purpose may be to test functionality alone, narrowly defined.</li>
	<li>Unified debugging pattern (to unify teams on debugging tools, concepts, tips, tricks)</li>
	<li>QA guidelines &amp; nomenclature specification (e.g., defect severity definitions, defect assignment protocols; acts as a guideline from UI to QA which informs the process for assigning defects, with hope to promote more assignment accuracy and accelerated turn-around times)</li>
</ol>
<h5>Sub-discussion: UI/UX Science</h5>
The following list is composed of more readily identifiable concepts which constitute the conceptual foundation that sustains the discussion between User Interface and User Experience Teams.

A User Interface developer may contrive such a list while reviewing the User Experience Team's deliverables. So, I tend to call this a "UI Ontology." Perhaps: the Candidate Ontology for that Developer.
<ol>
	<li>Special UI Elements (Common &amp; Unique; e.g., carousels, tickers, widgets, calendars, etc.)</li>
	<li>Problematic areas (e.g., Integration points, CMS generated code, etc.)</li>
	<li>Structure (<em>more so </em>a statement <em>that </em>these elements exist, <em>less so</em> a statement <em>of where </em>these elements should be visually situated; e.g., footer, header, nav; property of <em>Layout types</em>)</li>
	<li>Heavy CSS Elements</li>
	<li>Headers (sidebar headers, footer headers, body copy headers, site headers, etc.)</li>
	<li>Modules/Web parts/Widgets, etc. (existing &amp; novel)</li>
	<li>Content types</li>

		<title>Standardizing CSS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't think CSS is abstract enough. Most UI developers don't, which explains the existence of grid systems and "frameworks." These tools can do no more than answer the problem: In respecting the separation of concerns w/r/t the relationship between HTML and other layers of the UI, to what extent should abstractions be included in UI development practices and what should the language of those abstractions be; as the names of that language should constitute the conventions of those practices.

HTML is the language of the Web. In HTML documents, this markup language <em>describes</em>, in a largely typographical way, <em>content</em> while giving it <em>form</em>. The markup languages tells us that something is a paragraph or a header, an unordered list or a data table. These formats are historically grounded in print production, typesetting, typography, desktop publishing, what is proverbially known as <em>print. </em>In <em>authoring </em>an HTML document, a web developer is not herself <em>the author </em>of what is being said, but rather <em>an author of how to say it in the context of the Web.</em> In much the same way  that <em>House Style </em>rules at the end of the day, thus enabling the rapid production of content, HTML is <em>the House Style of the Web.</em> UI Developers, HTML coders, frontend engineers, etc. are thus <em>authors of the Web.</em>

Of course upon first impression one may notice that the vocabulary of HTML is fairly small, yet we should not assume that HTML itself it is "limited." The derivation and affinity of its syntax to SGML and XML support its robustness and range of application (metadata, DOM, microformats, XSLT, etc.). These concerns aside, the "language of the Web" says little about the typographical elements and attributes which come from HTML but rather the more obscurely known DIV, SPAN, @class, @id, and others: tags and elements <em>that lack inherent meaning</em>. From a typesetter's look, these entities play the necessary analogous role of enabling one to conceptualize margins, gutters, space. CSS indeed gives us the ability to undertake typesetting, design and layout, but the notion of the meaningless entities partly defines the practice of developing CSS and JavaScript.

In HTML5 we see this class of entity, the meaningless entity, receive greater attention. The ARTICLE, FOOTER, ASIDE and others, we are to understand, behave much the same as the DIV.

<em> </em><em>HTML Descriptions</em> are computational and communal in nature; they are bridges between an manifest agreement in language within the social structure of human beings and an explicit standard implicitly adopted by computer systems. I say "adopted" for the fact that figurative qualities aside, crawlers, bots, scrubbers, spiders, and other algorithmically trained entities are, from a UI developer's look, each <em>readers</em>. What matters here is the <em>flow, </em>the flow of document content.

Form and flow in HTML are tricky since <em>form </em>is manifest under a multitude of interpretations; e.g., typographically (distinct from the typographical description

Yes, I was arrested for possession. I arrested for "0-2oz," sure, but do the details in such matters mean the world? Absolutely. Do journalistic entities bear such a burden to detail on pain of functioning as nothing more than a public nuisance? Again: absolutely. My main question, which I believe is a very complex one: <em>Who is this article's target audience?</em> Such an article, in terms of its style and substance, demands that you read it with a certain frame of mind unless you happen to fit within its target audience, otherwise it is tragically uninformative<em>. </em>The article, in a way, confesses this by noting that it was derived from exactly that entity which performed the arrest. Of course, offenders are offenders regardless of offense, and the tradition of "crime reporting" is a "tradition" that cannot change.

E-mail sent (surely the beginning of a correspondence or at least a series of rants):

Could you at least grab more facts about the arrest? Two people were arrested. It was at a park. It was by a patrol officer. We're people living in this community too, a community claim to give insight into. Well, respect its members, too. We're not just a bunch of houses and tax zones. Do we not deserve some kind of respect at least WITHIN that community? You would expect _this_ quality of journalism from a major news source, oblivious to detail because it has to be. But this entire site is presumably about Montrose, and its news is written in such an impersonal, lifeless way, it comes off as nothing less than malicious incompetence. To say the least, this article is juvenile. On its journalistic merits alone I find it appalling and embarrassing. Point is, this is supposed to be a news site that gives insight into a community and its members, but this article comes off like a unit of information for a realtor or a lawyer seeking to make generalizations. I cannot even make it to your "about" page to figure out what your mission statement is supposed to be, to judge whether this article is consistent with that general goal. Again, juvenile, amateurish ... and just sad.
<div>On a personal note, don't you think I've been pushed around enough just trying to free myself from the financial and emotional chains of actually being arrested? Now you give me this? This is the worst. This utterly fails as any sort of respectable journalism, and now I feel disrespected. I mean, you know Harris County's corrupt and intolerable history, why on earth would you want to DERIVE your news directly from them? Why would you want to DERIVE your news from such an unreliable, painfully pithy news source? Without any quality control? I refuse to believe any writer in your midst would find such succinctness charitable, where exposure, detail, clarity and information is certainly due since, regardless of my personal concerns, I am nevertheless still a member of the community with whom you may wish to keep at least relatively decent affiliations.</div>
<div>Instead, this article makes the Chron out to be some kind of impersonal (not "objective"), narrow-minded, shoddy spy.</div>
<div>What does "Ultimate Montrose" even mean, anyway? Just the Internet trying to make sense of it all.</div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Hey, what are you up to?" Often I reject the question on the grounds that a human being, with all its "wit" and "richness atrocity" and "complexity" and "intelligence" and "talent," that a human being with all of that, and sorts by sorts, and all, should find it trivial, quite trivial indeed, to recall what another human being was up to last met. It might seem one is overzealous in one's expectations on the human condition, yet it is quite unclear that expectation and assumption amount to what is the same thing.

<blockquote>Danny Bensi (Cello, Violin, Piano, Vocals), Saunder Jurriaans (Guitar, Bass, Vocals), and Gregory Rogove (Drums, Percussion, Piano, Melodica, Glockenspiel, Vocals) comprise the shuddering anthems of Tarantula A.D. Blending classical arrangements with elements of punk and metal, Tarantula A.D. delivers a hypnotic prog-rock sound with an ambient atmosphere. [...]

When John Zorn dines with an entire pantheon of ancient Roman Gods, this album happens.

<strong>School of Emotional Engineering - Self-titled</strong>

<blockquote>The name draws inspiration from a single line in Aldous Huxley's prophetic social critique <em>Brave New World.</em>

School of Emotional Engineering is a loosely defined 'band', more of a 'project' created by composer Ben Frost. Primarily Frost, alongside multi-instrumentalist and engineer Daniel Rejmer, bassist and guitarist Andy Hazel, violin player Russell Fawkus and drummer Jova Albers, School of Emotional Engineering (S.E.E) began originally in Melbourne, Australia as a live extension of Frost's solo work.

"...like watching a knife fight in a phone booth." The album is mostly bright ambient noise and soft keys with tracks blurring into each other, but occasionally heavy, moderate tempo drum beats will burst into the dense soundscapes. Lots of beautiful layering. It's not so much an album of tracks as it is a lengthy train of emotionally wavering thoughts and musical forces.

<strong>Shellac - Excellent Italian Greyhound</strong>
<img src="http://nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/513nw-tlfil.jpg" style="width: 200px" />
<blockquote>Shellac did not release any records between 1000 Hurts in 2000 and "Excellent Italian Greyhound" in 2007, but songs which were to appear on the latter record formed the mainstay of their live-shows in the intervening period - in particular, "The End of Radio", "Paco", "Steady as She Goes", "Be Prepared", "Genuine Lulabelle", "Boycott", and "Elephant" (formerly known as "Repeat The Lie"). Excellent Italian Greyhound is named in tribute to Todd Trainer's Italian Greyhound, Uffizi; it was released on Touch and Go Records in June 2007.
–Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_%28band%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac_%28band%29</a></blockquote>
Why am I so late? This album released in June of this year. It's <em>signature </em>Shellac – frenetic Albini riffery, powerful Trainer drumming, routinely drilling Weston bass, screaming rambled vocals – and look out for <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifrxqy5ldje">Ken Nordine</a> on "Genuine Lulabelle". <em>Buy it.</em> This album needs to be heard on vinyl, and like <em>1000 Hurts</em>, it comes with an unmarked CD, for encouragement to buy it vinyl.

		<title>A Refutation of the Problem of Evil?, pt. 1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.epicurus.info/"><img src="http://nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/epicurus_bust.jpg" alt="epicurus-eyes" /></a>

We must first make note that Epicurus (341-270 BCE) never actually wrote any literature stating the argument, but rather it was formulated as a riddle and passed along through oral tradition. The riddle first appears in <em>De Rerum Natura</em>, a powerful philosophical epic poem written by Roman poet Lucretius Carus (99-55 BCE), a strict disciple of Epicurean philosophy.

What the problem of evil (POE) represents is an atheistic proposition for why an omnipotent, omniscience and omnibenevolent supreme being cannot logically exist. It is an argument stemming from the highlighted contradiction of such a being. Keep in mind that this argument was presented by an ancient Greek philosopher almost 300 years before the establishment of Christian Rome and 300 years, more or less, before Moses began writing the religious text which defined and saw to existence the Abrahamic God of Christianity, Judaism and Islam.

<strong>Original proposition:</strong>
<blockquote>Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to. If he wants to, but cannot, he is impotent. If he can, but does not want to, he is wicked. If God can abolish evil, and God really wants to do it, why is there evil in the world?–Epicurus, as quoted in <em>2000 Years of Disbelief</em></blockquote>
David Hume restates the original proposition given by Epicurus in his <em>Dialogues concerning Natural Religion</em>.
<blockquote>Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent.
Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent.
Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?
–David Hume, quoting Epicurus</blockquote>
Now for the counterargument, with its theological muscle, strengthened under the disciple of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodicy" title="A branch of theology established for the sole purpose of this riddle. Nice one, Epicurus!">theodicy</a>, it supposedly refutes the paradox of problem of evil completely.

<strong>Counterargument:</strong> <a href="http://www.christian-thinktank.com/gr5part1.html">http://www.christian-thinktank.com/gr5part1.html</a>

Briefly, the author-theologian restates the Problem of Evil for further analysis.
<blockquote>1. The world is characterized by vast amounts of intensive and extensive suffering and evil.

2. After enduring a life of hardship and pervasive suffering, many (if not most) humans will end up in hell, where they will be actively tortured forever and ever.

3. All of this was known ahead of time by God, before He had even created ANYTHING or ANYONE.

4. For some reason or motive, He "went ahead" with the plan anyway, but could have chosen to not implement it (or to start a different one altogether) or to interrupt it before it "went bad".</blockquote>
I am posting this now because I will eventually completely read the refutation and provide my own critique of it. I have a few initial ideas of why it is incorrect, but I will let them warm over in my thoughts for now.What is interesting, however, is that the author notes the Logical Problem of Evil (POE) is actually no longer a philosophically tenable argument nor is the Evidential Problem of Evil. Granted, he goes through almost excruciating lengths to disprove these two stances, but more importantly, he notes that contemporary philosophers no longer consider it a viable argument for their arsenal. This means that amongst philosophical circles and amongst debates, it should no longer be considered a sort of trump card against or threat to the theologian. This is important knowledge for any casual atheist or agnostic who enjoys keeping a few argumentative cards in his or her deck. <em>The argument of the problem of evil may not so easily convince many people, and you may find yourself, at worst, succumbing to belief.</em> That is, if the <em>only </em>reason for your atheism is the comfort in knowing that this riddle has gone unmatched and undefeated – it would most definitely be a surprise, if you are persuaded by the argument I've provided above.]]></content:encoded>

"Jonathan Miller meets up with some of the key contributors from his three-part Brief History of Disbelief in these half-hour extended conversations."

List of interviewees: Arthur Miller, Colin McGinn, Steven Weinberg, Richard Dawkins, Denys Turner, Daniel Dennett

"I discovered that it was simply philosophy on its own that had played the very much larger role in the gradual erosion of belief."

<blockquote>From a shift in earnest to democracy,
Wars of affirmations of independence,
Lived briefly... We have thrived pitifully
In our dissent to perilous plutocracy, only
To find ourselves enduring the media
Corruption birthing an autocratic theocracy.
And we are content with unrest and distant
Unfathomable turmoils, cascaded by legislation,
Writs to alienation and intellectual disease;
It is the beauty of our nation.
<em>God </em>Bless America.</blockquote>

Generalizations abound; redundant and nonsensical.]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>Jonathan Miller visits the absent Twin Towers to consider the religious implications of 9/11 and meets Arthur Miller and the philosopher Colin McGinn. He searches for evidence of the first 'unbelievers' in Ancient Greece and examines some of the modern theories around why people have always tended to believe in mythology and magic.

A brilliant introduction to the history of disbelief. Uploaded because this needs to be available as a shining light of the historicity of reason midst the dark depths and oceans of media absurdity and religious propaganda. So few representatives of atheism provide a compelling and earnest account for unbelief, let alone with the lucidity and intellectual vigor of Jonathan Miller. He is sincere and moving in this attempt to explain and understand the origins of disbelief in his own life and for us all.

Should the BBC or the producers find it inappropriate for me to have uploaded this video, I will gladly remove it upon their request. Otherwise, enjoy. I will be uploading part  2, Noughts and Crosses, soon, but not part 3, as <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6491394409348890507">part 3</a> is readily available through Google Video at the moment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src='http://nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/fairtrade-vertical-colour.jpg' alt='fairtrade-vertical-colour.jpg' style="float: right;" />Original report: <a href="http://www.fairtrade.net/annual_reports0.html">FLO Annual Reports page</a>
My super custom highlighted report: <a href='http://nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/flo_ar_2007.pdf' title='FLO Annual Report 2007'>Highlighted Annual Report</a>

<strong>Key topics of the report:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>FLO managing director, Luuk Zonneveld, leaves on good terms, praising the organization's triumphs and hoping for continued success.</li>
	<li>Three new producer networks (<acronym title="Coordinadora
Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Comercio Justo">CLAC</acronym>, <acronym title="African Fairtrade
Network">AFN</acronym>, <acronym title="Network of Asian Producers">NAP</acronym>) join FLO in co-ownership, allowing the producers to better voice themselves in the democratic infrastructure of the Fair Trade processes.</li>
	<li>Fair Trade Bananas, Coffee and Cotton meet booming markets.</li>
</ul>

The report introduces many of the global economic problems coffee producers have faced and have been able to prevail against due to the saving grace of Fair Trade.

<blockquote>In 2001 and 2002, during the world coffee crises, our situation was desperate. We received between 20-25 dollars per quintal (quintal = 100 pounds, 25 US$ per quintal = 0, 25 US$/lb) ... many of the Ecuadorian coffee producers left. We did not have any other choice but to abandon the coffee culture. We are currently selling 80 % of our total coffee production under Fairtrade terms. For our Fairtrade organic coffee we are receiving 139 US$ the quintal and 119US$ the quintal for our conventional Fairtrade coffee. But more important than the higher prices is the stability that Fairtrade brings. We are not as vulnerable to market volatility as we used to be.
&ndash;Valentín Chinchay, the President of <acronym title="Federación Regional de Asociaciones de Pequeños Cafetaleros Ecológicos del Sur">FAPECAFES</acronym></blockquote>

There's a lot of other empowering and joyous achievement to be read: Fair Trade Towns rising in parts of Europe and the growth of desire for Fair Trade bananas in the global market being two particulars. The report gives you multiple testimonials of some of the social and economical improvements of Third World producing and farming societies that result from the Fair Trade premiums. It's all good stuff, so check it out.

Comprised of members Jonny Ashe on guitar, Alex Donald on bass, Michael Kinloch on guitar and Keith Winter on drums, our Irish ensemble produces music of sonic charge and carefully tangled melodic thoughts in their debut full length, <em>Flux and Form.</em></p>
Their compositions trail a great distance in style from your standard radio rock sessions; however, anyone moderately attentive to the up and rising post-rock movement will tell you this band is just one amongst many. This would not be a very accurate description of the thoughtful and spellbinding music that comes from this album. Of course, it is, from head-to-toe, intensely and completely instrumental, but, like with most post-rock bands, that does not remove any greatness from the music itself, even if you may consider it a guilty pleasure. No, it is less than arguable that we have been given a pleasant new perspective into understanding the truth of musical beauty. And surely, Tracer AMC does not fail to please.

From this relation to the genre to which they are generally filed under, we venture into the first track, "Some Electric,"—the beginning of how they differ—, other notable tracks and some general thoughts on this album.

"Some Electric" introduces the album with a melancholy of melodic dual interwoven guitar riffs and soft cymbals as a noticeable crescendo slowly breathes in its air. Eventually soft crashes of cymbals and toms and subtle flickering guitar melodies become warmed over in the presence of a complementary violin. The build up continues as the sounds of each instrument bolster into a sort of wall of sound until we are met with an explosive release of noisy intent and driving guitars. Soon after, the track shrinks down to sounds of distinct melodic humility and warmth.

The first track gives us a review of the structure of noise to come as the rest of the tracks, remarkably, with the exception of a few purely sweet lullabies, keeps to the format of progressive and blending soft-loud segments. Throughout the drumming is also crisp, clean and controlled, supportive of the whole of the ensemble and never deviating into tangents. Many of the tracks like "Some Electric," "Flux and Form," and "Blue Thread" enjoy moments of blasting walls of sound, as described previously, sometimes more furious and moving than loud, other times simply loud and moving.

Sleep Trick is a crowd favorite, neatly fit under the "lullaby" category for this album, it lulls but deceivingly lures you into a soundscape of beautiful and playful, swirling guitars. This sound is by far the most accessible of the album.

The three epics "Catherine Holly," "Copenhagen," and "Nineteen" each consist of chapters in themselves of progressive rock tendencies, raging movements of sound and equally present soft riddling themes.

<em>Flux and Form</em> expresses a valid control over musical composition and transition. It is a work of art carefully attended to from corner to corner, no single track breaking its ultimate train of thought.]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>With the domination of Christianity from 500 AD, Jonathan Miller wonders how disbelief began to re-emerge in the 15th and 16th centuries. He discovers that division within the Church played a more powerful role than the scientific discoveries of the period. He also visits Paris, the home of the 18th century atheist, Baron D'Holbach, and shows how politically dangerous it was to undermine the religious faith of the masses.

<blockquote>The history of disbelief continues with the ideas of self-taught philosopher Thomas Paine, the revolutionary studies of geology and the evolutionary theories of Darwin. Jonathan Miller looks at the Freudian view that religion is a 'thought disorder'. He also examines his motivation behind making the series touching on the issues of death and the religious fanaticism of the 21st century.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em><strong>Appendix I</strong></em> to the first chapter of Ethics: Of God
<blockquote>
Of course this is not the place to deduce these things from the nature of the human mind. It will be sufficient here if I take as a foundation what everyone must acknowledge: that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things, and that they all want to seek their own advantage, and are conscious of this appetite. From these [assumptions] it follows, <em>first</em>, that men think themselves free, because they are conscious of their volitions and their appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes by which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are ignorant of [those causes]. It follows, <em>second</em>, that men act always on account of an end, namely, on account of their advantage, which they want. Hence they seek to know only the final causes of what has been done, and when they have heard them, they are satisfied, because they have no reason to doubt further. But if they cannot hear them from another, nothing remains for them but to turn toward themselves, and reflect on the ends by which they are usually determined to do such things; so they necessarily judge the temperament of the other from their own temperament.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Furthermore, they find&mdash;both in themselves and outside themselves&mdash;many means that are very helpful in seeking their own advantage, for example, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, plants and animals for food, the sun for light, the sea for supporting fish [NS: and so with almost all other things whose natural causes they have no reason to doubt]. Hence, they consider all natural things as means to their own advantage. And knowing that they had found these means, not provided them for themselves, they had reason to believe that there was someone else who had prepared those means for their use. For after they considered things as means, they could not believe that the things had made themselves; but from the means they were accustomed to prepare for themselves, they had to infer that there was a ruler, or a number of rulers, of Nature, endowed with human freedom, who had taken care of all things for them, and made all things for their use.
</blockquote><blockquote>And since they had never heard anything about the temperament of these rulers, they had to judge it from their own. Hence, they maintained that the gods direct all things for the use of men in order to bind men to them and be held by men in the highest honor. So it has happened that each of them has thought up from his own temperament different ways of worshiping God, so that God might love him above all the rest, and direct the whole of Nature according to the needs of their blind desire and insatiable greed. Thus this prejudice was changed into superstition, and struck deep roots in their minds. This was why each of them strove with great diligence to understand and explain the final causes of all things.
</blockquote><blockquote>But while they sought to show that Nature does nothing in vain (i.e., nothing not of use to men), they seem to have shown only that Nature and the gods are as mad as men. See, I ask you, how the matter has turned out! Among so many conveniences in Nature they had to find many inconveniences: storms, earthquakes, diseases, and the like. These, they maintain, happen because the gods [NS: (whom they judge to be of the same nature as themselves)] are angry on account of wrongs done to them by men, <em>or</em> on account of sins committed in their worship. And though their daily experience contradicted this, and though infinitely many examples showed that conveniences and inconveniences happen indiscriminately to the pious and the impious alike, they did not on that account give up their long-standing prejudice. It was easier for them to put this among other unknown things, whose use they were ignorant of, and so remain in the state of ignorance in which they had been born, than to destroy that whole construction, and think up a new one.
</blockquote><blockquote>So they maintained it as certain that the judgments of the gods far surpass man's grasp. This alone, of course, would have caused the truth to be hidden from the human race to eternity, if mathematics, which is concerned not with ends, but only with the essences and properties of figures, had not shown men another standard of truth. And besides mathematics, we can assign other causes also, which were able to bring it about that men [NS:&mdash;but very few in relation to the whole human race&mdash;] would notice these common prejudices and be led to the true knowledge of things.
&mdash;Baruch Spinoza (1632&ndash;1677), Of God &ndash; <em>Ethics</em></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>I am told God loves me -- and yet the reality of darkness & coldness & emptiness is so great that nothing touches my soul.
&mdash;Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, <em>Mother Teresa</em> (1910-1997)</blockquote>

Either her doubts are irrelevant to the doctrine or her doubts disconfirm it, but they certainly do not substantiate it. If we cannot say her expressed and apparent <em>disbelief</em> is a good indication of whether or not she believed, then we are implicitly claiming that her faith existed in a vacuum. Therefore, not one person's faith can be used to validate the doctrine nor should it be used validate another person's faith. It's puzzling that any Protestant or Roman Catholic should consider her faith (or lack thereof) as an empowerment to their own.

But to call her heroic or inspiring <em>because</em> of her revealed doubts? I recall doubt being a necessary consequent of faith, but I refer to a specific kind of doubt. For it is such that we all have doubts in a general sense, but <em>religious doubt</em> cannot be unless <em>religious faith</em> is at first present. It is quite clear to me that her religious faith had expired <em>absolutely</em>, if her words can be said to be representative of her thoughts.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The Creator of the Universe takes an interest in me, approves of me, loves me, and will reward me after death; my current beliefs, drawn from scripture, will remain the best statement of the truth until the end of the world; everyone who disagrees with me will spend an eternity in hell.
&mdash;Sam Harris, <em>Letter to a Christian Nation</em></blockquote>

All the fat has been trimmed, all the obscurity diluted. Take away anymore, and you've got yourself a non-Christian. The frightening thing is that although this caricature is arguably strikingly simplified, there is still a large sum of weighty philosophical, moral and numerous other implications. Naturally, the Theologian will argue for what the dissenters mean by "Creator"; because the opposition never <em>understands</em> truly who or what the "Creator" is unless they themselves believe in Him. The belief ticket grants them access to that esoteric knowledge. At least with Scientology, you can buy your way up the ladder.

But can the Theologian downplay "interest," "approval," "love" and "reward" from their implications of arrogance? And without turning the discussion into a mess of unintelligible rhetoric and circular reasoning?

"the best statement of the truth" cannot be considered as a jab in the dark about what those Christians believe. But wait! The truth of <em>what</em> exactly? Moral truth? Scientific truth? Metaphysical truth? Maybe Sam Harris stepped into a poor generalization.

But certainly objection to that "truth" cannot twisted about; clearly, it is the case that those who object do in fact object! Unless, of course, they know not what they object, and if they <em>did</em>, bring on the ad hominem stir. Nonetheless, some must object, but not out of necessity. We know that dissent is a possibility for the Bible itself highlights the capability of doubt. The message depends necessarily on that it reaches new ears, those unknowing or those skeptical. So it prepares for doubt, with the likes of Thomas especially. So the believer and the Theologian must agree that some do doubt, and those carrying their disbelief genuinely do so with equal understanding to that of the believer and Theologian.

And be Hell a state of being or a place of existence, nonetheless it carries a heavy moral burden to do the "right thing as right sees right" or certain punishments, whatever they may be, will follow. The concept of rewards and punishments cannot be argued as an inaccurate observance of a first principle of the theology.]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>Between the years 1845 and 1860, a large contingent of German Freethinkers immigrated to the Texas Hill Country. Unlike the thousands of Adelsverein-sponsored German farmers immigrating to the United States and Texas to escape overpopulation and economic problems, the Freethinkers, being ardent advocates of democracy and freedom from religion, were fleeing primarily from political and religious tyranny. They came to the United States seeking freedom from dictatorial monarchies and clerics.

I'm not sure why I received such a hefty serving of Rand; she's only an emphasizer of rationality, but her moral philosophy is ghastly. It may just be the simplicity of the assessment that lumps many of these far-opposed philosophers together.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is not an exhaustive criticism of the arguments therein, but, in studying, I have found an easy distraction.

<strong>Related post:</strong> <a href="http://nerdfiles.net/2007/08/03/refutation-of-the-problem-of-evil-pt-1/">A Refutation of the Problem of Evil?, pt. 1</a>

The author-theologian attempts to appeal to negative popularity in scholarship. This says nothing about the strength of argument which the problem of evil possesses; it is a fruitless endeavor and, might I add, poor etiquette to suggest the opposing argument has somehow been conclusively refuted. If the argument is beneath scholars, then obviously laypeople are just spreading their ignorance.

Nonetheless, I feel I should say a word about the opposition this author presents. The counterargument forms from the presupposition that God exists and is compatible with evil (by nature, a theodicean argument); following, what is presented is an attempt to provide two refutations to the argument from the problem of evil (logical and evidential):

<strong>Logical problem of evil counterargument:</strong>
(1) God's will is unknowable to us;
(2) We cannot adequately reason as to God's motives for the allowance of evil to exist (because God by nature is super-intelligent);
(3) The inadequacy of our reason does not permit us to properly question his motives (because we do not understand this super-intelligence, and thus neither his will);
(4) [Additionally, his divine will (hinged on his super-intelligence) depends on the assumption of his supernatural existence.]
(5) Therefore, God <em>must</em> have some sort of will or reason for evil. In order to have this will or reason, which is beyond humanity's grasp, God exists in order for that will or reason to exist.

You can easily see the superficiality and circularity of this argument. The fault in this argument is its self-imposed limit to <em>only </em>address the problem of evil but not to question the truth of the premise of God's existence.

<strong>Evidential problem of evil counterargument:</strong>

<blockquote>Much suffering, pain, and even evil (in its painful consequences) can be seen to contribute to good outcomes. Physiological pain is largely preventative; natural disasters often provoke positive community responses and integration; heinous moral evil often challenges us to stronger moral stances; painful consequences of evil choices often serve to lead us to change our patterns of choices, and/or inspires those "watching us" to do so, for more extensive impact. The fact that much suffering can be clearly related to a good outcome creates a prima facie case for believing that all suffering might eventually be seen to be non-gratuitous (contributory) to some greater good. Hence, we have positive evidence to dispute the inscrutability/gratuity connection.</blockquote>

The evidential counterargument attempts to obscure gratuitousness with inscrutability, thus claiming that when an atheistic argument is posed that certain forms of evil are unnecessary for a greater good, the argument is produced from one's own ignorance of how evil can eventually produce some good. That is, the atheist in fact does not understand what evil is, or our ability to judge what is evil is obscured by our own ignorance. It becomes quite clear that if we cannot call any event or tragedy, such as genocide or rape, unnecessarily evil or "gratuitous," we actually cannot call anything evil whatsoever. Evil, in a disturbing way, becomes blurred out of reality due to our own ignorance.

Both counterarguments thrive on the same theme: ignorance of God's divine will and ignorance of God's tactical and incremental strategy to produce the end effect of that divine will. However, both arguments suffer from the false premise that all theodicean arguments are burdened with: reconciling a false compound assumption [God's existence and God by definition is "good"] in order to make the problem vanish.

The true inefficacy of this sort of argument comes from the moral implications that derive from it. Let it be granted that these counterarguments establish the reconcilable nature of God with the problem of evil; however, in the context of this given theory, the sort of morality borne of these arguments only pertain to God. We, as human beings, cannot function and progress believing that all evil is, by its essential nature, not really at all evil but only the strategy for a good. In fact, we <em>do not</em> live this way; if we did, we would not attempt to remedy certain perceived evils. This sort of theodicy cannot both claim validly that some evil is actually a good for God's will <em>and,</em> at the same time, that some evil is actually good for us [humanity]. 

Instrumentally, these theodicean arguments are barren. This fact becomes apparent when you cannot but ask yourself: In what way is the human good similar to God's type of good? Upon reflecting on this question, I doubt it will be difficult to understand that our forms of "the good" are relative and, consequently, similar in nothing but the name. If you start an ant farm, thus becoming the all-powerful benefactor to a society of tiny creatures, the sort of effects you perceive as good are that your ants harvest sugar you provide for their queen, till the soil within the container, and live in relative security. These are the sorts of common goods you and the ants share; however, there exist certain good effects which only pertain to you as the supreme governor. These creatures provide some sort of amusement to you or they bear an grander purpose which they themselves cannot conceive of. At best, this is the type of purpose, or goodness, that we can equate God as having [granting the God of passions and will]. What we learn from this analogy is that those occurrences within the society of ants are positive (good) and negative (evil) relative to their interests; and those same occurrences are positive and negative relative to your own. The ants do not function in such a way as to take your interests at heart; it is not in their nature to act toward a good which they cannot discern as good. The well-being of their queen or their kingdom is their ultimate good; yours is distant or unintelligible to them at best.

From this we can only say that the sorts of things we consider good may correlate to the things which the God of passions and will calls good, but to say so with certainty is foolish and arrogant. Like with the ants, their livelihood is good for radically different reasons, both to you and to them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Religion is a social institution. If you wish to argue for its apparent necessity, you can have your case; but this argument will never suffice for the truth. Because, as I see it, the truth depends nothing other than itself. Anything other than the truth, and even our striving to attain to it, is condemned to be divisive and will amount to bloodshed and turmoil. In science, with all its models and methods, there can <em>only</em> be a contrast to religion as humanity's best attempt for objectivity: for religion postulates grandly, then makes amends, and science merely attempts to systematically confirm what we seemingly must logically infer about the world. 

But yet, we feel something beyond the science that we trust, and in philosophy we have quibbled for civilizations over what that something is, whereas religion reduces its chief concerns to nothing greater than sectarian violence, intellectual depravity and socializing. And in these religions, so quick are their adherents to put a name on this awesome thing which they know nothing of through their reason; easily following is their worship and pursuit to the glory of its name. It becomes love or liberty or benevolence, terms that, to these minds, seem to exist in domains outside of reason. I feel no greater absurdity can be produced by the intellects of men and women.

After making these considerations and dwelling on them with sincerity, the only reasonable discourse I had discerned in which to direct myself, for the perfection of my own person, was philosophy; for in it only does one learn true humility and love. 

Just in case you are wondering, "Well, why the hell did he switch his major to philosophy?" It may sound trivial that I speak of "love" and, as you might now have determined, "unity"; but these ideas are, as I consider them, the furthest from traditional forms of love and togetherness. In a most basic description: It is the sort of love one feels after attempting a difficult geometrical proof yet only applied to people, animals and things.

It's feeeeeeeeeeelosophy.]]></content:encoded>

After the crushing noise, I could not help but feel completely disjoined from reality. It was as if I my person had been converted into a self entirely autonomous and <em>necessary</em> thing...

It was a constancy in terms of only nihilism. How can any singular thing <em>be</em> a necessity (not determined)? The conclusion: Nihilism is your worst enemy and your only friend.

		<title>A Reflection on the Content of Atheism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I should hope to elucidate the basic definition of atheism for you, but this is by no means an exhaustive endeavor. It is being done with the hope that in considering atheism for yourself, you will have a concrete understanding of that which you vacillate in your mind.

Now, for some reason, people just assume atheism means this or that, but we all [should] know that atheism is by no means a philosophy nor is it a system of thought.

To be "atheist" really says nothing about what you do believe, but only states that you do not consider "God" or gods to be the substrate of all reality.

It's a peculiar thing for believers to face someone who says, "Aha! I'm an atheist," because atheists usually are unaware that "atheism" is a term which only bears content in the face of a theism. Not to cast their intelligence in any negative light, but "atheism" really is a unique term. It eludes even some of the most learned of philosophers.

So let it be granted that assumptions of theism are not present: Well, now an atheist has said absolutely nothing. It really should be the job of atheists to properly explain what atheism is, and then go further to explain what they personally believe. After all this skull drudgery, it is of utmost importance to explain even further that: Atheism is not humanism; Atheism is not spiritualism; Atheism is not Naturalism; Atheism is not Materialism, and so on.

Atheism is a rather contextual stance. It cannot exist on its own. In my personal day-to-day thought, I make it easy on myself by considering atheism to be an "argumentative stance." That is, outside of the realm of argumentation, atheism really is nothing to talk about. You can't have an "atheist's values" or an "atheist's worldview." You can have atheistic values or atheistic worldviews, yes, for it is such that these values or worldviews would be described as existing without the shaky axiom of God's existence. But in these philosophies, it would be folly to describe them by a main characteristic of being atheistic.

Now these concepts or worldviews, as stated previously, are compatible with atheism, but they are by no means equivalent. For instance, Karl Marx, the chief author of dialectic Communism, was an atheist because he was a materialist (he saw no necessity in religion and no use for the postulate of God's existence or role in his dialectic materialism), but to attack him for his "atheism," which is what was predominately done, obscures the arguments he held for materialism, and it sets a potential for straw men arguments against atheists who are not materialists. So rather than considering his materialistic philosophy purely, one could easily find himself or herself making tangential arguments against atheism; and it should be noted that although atheistic, Marx himself saw atheism too as a completely useless term. But this is all because he was so caught up in his somewhat prophetic Communistic idealism.

Once we discern and understand "atheism" as different from the clutter of actual worldviews and philosophies, we can properly address the arguments which fall under it. After successfully doing this, I believe all of our faiths, whatever their flavor, can be enriched or critically assessed, for we have better understood the true standing of this concept which perpetually nicks at their heels.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The way I see it, scientists and philosophers equally have to postulate unique ideas which are not completely restricted by their traditions. But, in a way, I see philosophers' dabbling in otherness and otherworldliness as that which goes beyond science for science is restricted by only that it can materially validate in terms of demonstration. You may get the feeling that I am expressing an argument that favors theology, but philosophy has no set postulate that it attempts to wrap its mind around. Whereas theologians and the religious have their God, philosophers have only what they call wisdom. And even then, philosophical schools within destroy fundamental views of wisdom and even those most crucial to our common sense and daily living. Yet, it is the philosopher in all of us, including scientists, that enables for growth--at a certain point, we tell our philosophical leanings: Enough! However, the field of the philosophy makes its duty of wavering in the discontent of the unknown, attempting to systematize or destroy it, and everywhere in between. Now if you wish to argue for this or that restriction on philosophy that is outside of scientific discourse, we can debate that, but insofar as philosophy's relation to science, philosophy must be the supervening force. I consider this the case simply by virtue of the existence of the scientific method. It has become a necessitated separation that amounts to a sort of parallelism for how we approach life.

And I believe the intersection where science and philosophy meet, and have always met, is with metaphysics. Sure, people are jaded toward when philosopher's talk of metaphysics, but that's just because science itself is hard enough for people to grasp, let alone the abstraction of grueling applied mathematics.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On Apophatic Theology</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2007/10/10/on-apophatic-theology/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To do justice to this quasi-refutation, I will attempt to explain briefly what Apophatic Theology is, as a theological tradition within Christian and particularly Catholic circles. I will do so generally because at present my thoughts are quite general on the matter, and I do not wish to begin too ambitious a goal for myself as I write this.

Apophatic Theology, known as the "Negative Way" or Negative Theology, is a theological foundation for pursuing a better understanding of the nature of God. This basis for apprehending "knowledge" of his nature consists of no positive attribution to his essence that we would think in so far as positively describing it. To make a positive assertion to his essence can be demonstrated as uttering, "God is all-powerful". In this example, the speaker is claiming a positive attribute is within the definition of God. Another example would be to claim, "God is good".

Negative Theology approaches God in a quite different manner. In fact, the two traditions are diametrically opposed to one another. This reason stems from the psychological implication of believing one bears confidence as opposed to one bearing modesty in so far as perceiving one's self juxtaposed to that of God's imagined being. The imagination of mind attempts, as best as possible when making a positive assertion, to give God material presence. Positive Theology, as it were, finds itself smeared across populations and the masses, for it is far easier to comprehend as a social norm. Every day we engage the world through positive qualification of things only in so far to give them a place in our minds for understanding. Now a thing may be positively asserted as being good or bad, but nonetheless the description of that thing maintains a <em>positive</em> existence in our minds. 

The opposing theological school, as said, approaches God in a contrary manner. Psychological and social implications aside, I believe it will be sufficient to sooth my interest on this discussion for now to focus on the theological weight of this tradition. As I have explained, Positive Theology asserts positive claims which fall under the essence or are within the definition of God. On the face of it, you may find yourself easily perceiving that Negative Theologians do the opposite of this. However, I do not feel that essentially this is so, but I get ahead of myself; I have not given you a proper example of how these thinkers work.

"God is not ignorant"; "God is not weak". These and similar phrases lay the groundwork for how, in principle, this theological system endeavors to understand the true nature of God. Now we must understand that at the root of any theological system there exists the tenet for understanding. If this is not so, then we may dismiss any theology as advocating only blind obedience and myopic tradition. This is not in the best interest of human nature, and further it simply is not how human nature operates.

Now, what is the trick up the sleeve of this theology? It generally feels awkward and counterintuitive to suggest that one must approach God by a negative. What do positives and negatives mean to God, anyway? The question may be rubbed out with an answer that explains the infinite nature of God. The negative theologian must meditate on all those positive attributes we normally ascribe to God and erase them from the list of his or her mind. At this point, when no further attribute can be wiped away, we are left with what God, in essence, truly must be. Now this list may be long or brief, for human ingenuity can tackle the crucial attributes of God in possibly one single jump. "God is not evil"; well, certainly we have left ourselves to put God only within the domain of all things which are not evil. However, in order to make this non-assertion intelligible, we must make a false assumption somewhere along this line of argument. God has to be <em>something</em> positive at some point. All things not evil does not say much of anything about anything. Further, and more importantly, one must define what evil is before it can be said that something is <em>not</em> evil. So essentially, a positive assertion is being made, regardless of how superficially one attempts to twist the layout of the situation.

What this tradition of theology leads to is nothing more than a test of human wit and memory, grasping wildly for positive descriptors only to toss them out the window of our mind. Yet it must make the fundamental assumption that these descriptors even bear meaning and that this cannot be ascribed to God's essence. This does not lead to understanding, but only imaginative gymnastics. Further, we find ourselves uttering unintelligible nonsense if we are to ascribe attributes to God through a negative method because at the base of it, God's infinite essence <em>cannot</em> be described with our feeble language <em>in principle</em>. Therefore, the negative theologian has done only a disservice to the whole of theological tradition by making God a concept which requires feats of human wit to even discuss casually. In principle, this form of theology must assume that words bear concrete meaning. Since this is the case, they positively assert something of God only except through a confounded and absurd manner.]]></content:encoded>

I have no idea where this pangram came from, but it recently appeared in my font library program. I can't find it on the Google anywhere. If I find that I wrote it during a sleepy stupor, I'd be impressed. But I suppose it more reasonable to assume that it was dormant somewhere within the content files of the font program I use.

I tried to holoalphabetize the title. Can you tell?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So some kid from my mum's church decided to lend her a copy of Mere Christianity, by C.S. Lewis. I admit that I tried reading once before this powerhouse of intellectually rigorous and intimidating argumentation of Protestant Christian theology flavor, but I simply had not the talent to fully comprehend the subtle wit of the literature.

Oh wait. Metaphors preferred over definitions, equivocations, unsupported premises, logical fallacies, oversimplifications... And this is only in chapter one.

Here's a fantastic example:
<blockquote>As an organism, he [man] is subjected to various biological laws which he cannot disobey any more than an animal can. That is, he cannot disobey those laws which he shares with other things; but the law which is peculiar to his human nature, the law he does not share with animals or vegetables or inorganic things, <em>is the one he can disobey if he choose</em> (my emphasis).</blockquote>

What a terribly shaky assumption. He has merely assumed that the definition of human nature does not entail that it can be itself modified. And further, what is human nature? He has yet again assumed that we have attained the objective definition of human nature.

He goes on to tackle discrepancies in moralities and how they do not amount to true differences. How does he tackle this crucial topic, handled by thousands of academics in anthropology and social philosophy? Well, with a metaphor, of course!

<blockquote>Think of a country where people were admired for running away in battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country where two and two made five.</blockquote>

Now some reviewers on Amazon.com try to give Lewis a nod to his literary ability, but this is just not justified. It may be that his logic is so profoundly absurd that his rhetorical power is completely lost to me.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Wanking Off Wittgenstein (circa TLP)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After reading a bit on feminist philosophy and reflecting on some past conversation with a friend, I found myself locked in consideration of a Spinozistic metaphysic. Let us see where the limits of this metaphysical philosophy takes my own thought in this discourse and if I can land upon some unique insight of my own toward the truth. For another time, I would like to think of ways in which my own philosophical views are in fact confined to patriarchal perpetuation. 

In truth, I consider gender as nothing more than a fictitious and philosophically unfounded distinction; however, feminist philosophers tend to believe that concepts such as reason, contrasted to emotion, are inherently primarily "male" attributes of reality. And male philosophers only exploit this manner of truth-finding because of their gender disposition. Further, as I come to understand this claim, it ought to be that emotion and reason, "chaos" and "rationality," as it were, are domains of existence which share equal value in so far as being properties of existence itself. It is my purpose here to attempt, however far I can, to establish that "randomness" is a fiction, subordinate to reason, as is emotion. Nature and Reason are the only truths, where inadequacy of understanding produces this concept of "true randomness," emotion as a true opponent to reason, along with, as you may like to imagine, a multitude of other chimeras which afflict humanity.

<h1 style='text-align: center; font-style: italic; display: block; font-size: 1.7em;'>A Practise Metaphysic</h1>
<br style="clear: both" />
<strong>1 </strong>There exist only necessary and contingent things. 

<strong>1.1</strong> A necessary thing is that which depends only on itself to exist.

<strong>1.11</strong> Necessary things will be the cause of themselves because they depend on nothing else. In this sense, cause is similar to the "cause" of produced things in only the name. A necessary thing is "caused" only in the sense that it is.

<strong>1.12</strong> A necessary thing, for argumentative purposes, may be viewed as a thing produced by chance or randomness in so far as both a necessary thing and a chance thing are both unrestricted with respect to laws or external things.

<strong>1.13</strong> Necessary things and chance things are closed systems.

<strong>1.2</strong> A contingent thing is that which depends on a necessary thing, greater contingent things, or processes by which contingent things produce other contingent things.

<strong>1.21</strong> A process by which contingent things produce other contingent things is effectively the same as a greater contingent thing in so far as it produces a lesser contingent thing.

<strong>1.3</strong> This is how questions must be framed.

<strong>1.31</strong> A question that equates chance things to necessary things presupposes that the definitions of the two are the same.

<strong>1.32</strong> A necessary thing bears a logical relation only to itself.

<strong>1.33</strong> A chance thing bears a logical relation only to contingent things.

<strong>1.34</strong> A necessary thing cannot be subject to chance. The fact that a necessary thing <em>is</em> must exclude the necessary thing from any real similarity to a chance thing.

<strong>1.4 </strong>A chance thing depends on both potentiality and probability.

<strong>1.41</strong> Potentiality, or possibility, says that a chance thing may be or come into being.

<strong>1.42</strong> Probability gives a certain degree of necessity to a chance thing.

<strong>1.5</strong> A necessary thing bears no potentiality or probability.

<strong>1.51</strong> A necessary thing, by virtue of existing, can bear only actuality.

<strong>1.52</strong> A necessary thing, by virtue of existing, can bear only absolute certainty in so far as its probability. In effect, it bears no probability but only absolute certainty.

<strong>2</strong> Randomness is a fiction, along with "chaos" and "chance."

<strong>2.1</strong> Nothing is truly random in relation to the whole but may appear as such in relation to other contingent things.

<strong>Reflection:</strong> To relate the concept of emotion to the concept of randomness in so far as emotion is produced from the concept of randomness is to commit a fallacy of applying a definition of that which is unknown to something equally unknown. Ex.: Emotions have an unknown origin because randomness is by definition unable to be understood. We have assumed that randomness exists (even if we do not, by nature if its concept, truly understand it), and arbitrarily ascribed emotion to definitively stem from that unknown. What exactly would the "Law of Randomness" contain in its definition beyond the mere assumption: "There is true chance." Can we assume by induction that in closed systems randomness exists? Would it not require that we step beyond the system itself? Are we in a closed system? Certain physical theorists have tended to think so. 

If we argue for chaos, we would equally find ourselves arguing that vacuums exist or that miracles bear physical reality and physical implications. By definition, "randomness" is that which is unknown; it is that which is unexplainable by causal law. True randomness, and not apparent randomness, is impervious to reason as reason is the means by which apparently random occurrences are understood. A truly random thing in so far as its relation to contingent things fictitiously instills in the minds of other contingent things&mdash;however much mind those contingent things bear&mdash;that it bears the exact nature of a necessary thing. 

Eventually, what is apparently random becomes ordered within the archive of what we call human knowledge. Reason must order its perceptions so that it may calculate and comprehend them. 

The idea that a chaotic thing may exist within order must presupposes that this chaotic thing depends only on itself or on something outside of the whole of ordered things which follow causal law, as has been said. In so far as things being perceivably ordered, must we assume axiomatically that casual law is the means by which those things are ordered? The major problem seems to form when we attempt to apply causal law to necessary, contingent and chance things. But are chance things fictions, or are they real? 

If we allow for true randomness (chance things to bear reality just as necessary and contingent things bear reality), we lose our ability to discern falsehoods. Chance things blur our ability to comprehend causality in so far as causality is applied to contingent things. Therefore, we must condemn all notions of true randomness as unessential and unhelpful to even our questions. Questions being framed and built upon necessary and contingent things as their constituents presuppose that an explanation can be attained. This is how we approach the sciences. This should be similarly how we approach all things in life, as you may have concluded, emotions as well. 

<strong>3</strong> Emotions, like chance things, are fictions not in so far as they bear relation only to contingent things but in so far as other contingent things bearing certain levels of mind and sentience perceive them as truly random things. 

<strong>3.1</strong> Emotions are contingent things which are ordered and subject to laws that place them in relation to other contingent things.

<strong>3.2</strong> Emotions must be treated as contingent things which maintain a certain order and can be understood completely.

<strong>3.3</strong> If we treat emotions as such, there may always be the possibility that we do not fully understand them. Ask yourself, do we fully understand physical laws? Do they convey objective truth in so far as objective truth reaches a deductive absoluteness? That is, objective truth is attained by numerous inductions as to attain it and, reaching that point, the consistency of results makes objective truth unshakably true. 

<strong>3.31</strong> Objective truth is acquired through induction which leads to certain deductive postulations.

<strong>3.4</strong> Understanding emotion fully will not lead to the predictability of emotion but to an increased intuitive knowledge. 

<strong>3.5</strong> The level of intuitive knowledge exists in proportion to decisions being made in accordance with Nature. The more so intuitive knowledge increases, more so are decisions made in accordance with Nature.

<strong>3.6</strong> Decisions made in accordance with Nature are constants that must always come to be, for contingent things are never outside of Nature. Our decisions are always intuitive rather than reasoned. 

<strong>3.61</strong> Our intuitions are increased by the procurement of inductive results and decisions are produced from the combination of intuition and instants of rational stopping. 

<strong>3.62</strong> <em>Rational stops</em> are attempts to cease intuitive decision making in order to find a contingent thought which, in so far as it is related to an infinite number of contingent things, we must assume it as true in order to establish it concretely to our minds in relation to that infinite continuum of contingent things.

<strong>3.63</strong> If the assumption fits in with the continuum as we perceive it, we keep it then disregard it as assumption and consider it a non-falsehood. More concise questioning then commences.

<strong>4</strong> Contingent things never being outside of Nature demands that no truly chance things ever exist.

<strong>4.1</strong> What benefit do we receive for truth finding by assuming hypothetical worlds for our arguments in which we implicitly claim chance things are not fictions? Can we even argue, from our domain of contingency, that hypothetical worlds actually bear any explanatory power to our own?

<strong>5</strong> We must then ask ourselves, despite what I have reflected upon: Is randomness a truth or a fiction? This is the most crucial question of all.

I leave off with a word from Benedict de Spinoza:
<blockquote>P35: Only insofar as men live according to the guidance of reason, must they always agree in nature.
&ndash;Benedict de Spinoza, IV. Of Human Bondage of <em>Ethics</em></blockquote>

These thoughts may appear to be immature and naïve to you, should you be an experienced philosopher. I only share them here because I needed a medium with which I may easily return to them and reflect, and the backspace key is much easier than an eraser as an editing tool. Re-ordering and adding postulations and comments must have been difficult for Wittgenstein. If he ordered them to his liking the first time, I would be endlessly impressed; but, as we all know, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus was a collection of notes. Further, it was sent through an editor, as with all published works.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Atheists: Free Will or Determinism</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2007/11/13/atheists-free-will-or-determinism/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style='font: 1.5em Palatino, Georgia; padding: 1em;'>Should Atheists have to tackle the Free will versus Determinism question?</div>

<div style='clear: both;'>I believe so, for atheism is only the rejection of a certain number of propositions for the existence of a deity. I do not think it follows that rejecting the existence of God necessarily rejects the ethical system of such that fall under the corresponding religion. To not be able to do this is to truly affirm the existence of a deity as being the foundation for the ethical system, in a very peculiar hypothetical sense. Surely our ancestors did not find this or that deity then derive an ethics from there. So we must presume that these ethical systems did not first posit that “God” exists and further went on to list the axioms of existence and morality. People formed rudimentary beliefs and built upon them with the ever-presence idea of some higher being in their minds. The name of the higher being actualized into a definite, signified entity which came to bear reverence after the system of belief was more or less fostered. 

What I aim to suggest here is that categorically all propositions exist on the same level. The assertion: "God exists!" is no more important or higher-as-a-category than the assertion that "Free will exists!" However, people tend to be more emotively connected to the label because they wish to consider it as the entrance into the system itself. It’s quite easy to say “I believe in God” without truly understanding what “God” means. The proposition of God's existence is no different categorically than that of the proposition that "Thou shalt not kill." Therefore, the propositions can be picked apart and tackled independently from one another, and it must be done by the "atheist," for the "atheist" is only challenging one proposition. That is, as a self-proclaimed atheist, from this title, they challenge or deny the argument of the existence of God, and consequently they must separately handle the determinism versus free will issue. 

But I suppose if the only argument an atheist receives that proves God exists is the argument from free will, and if she were to reject or deny that argument, then she would not have to tackle the determinism versus free will issue. It could be implied by her rejection that she consents to determinism of some flavor. This is due to the fact that I see determinism and free will as antithetical. Perhaps against a personal God theory, the rejection of such is an implicit consent to determinism. 

After that, we see that being an atheist is not a system of belief but only something which exists provisionally and only stands counter to some theism. Thus, a genuine, personal belief system should be created by the person who claims atheism, but their belief system will not be a reflection of the tenets of "atheism" itself. There can be no atheist bible or code of ethics or absolute philosophy of the atheist.

Does determinism require a determiner? To say this we must further question as to the nature of this determiner. And actually, does determinism require a determiner truly? Can it not be that things are all causally determined ad infinitum?  I suppose that would qualify as a form of necessitarianism which is a more obscure form of determinism which people do not often comprehend easily. 

But it is most certain that free will and determinism are not compatible for the sheer sake of future understanding and acquisition of knowledge. It is absurd to assert, "We are somewhat free and somewhat determined." Where do we even begin to test this sort of hypothesis? We would have to understand all of nature, or the universe, to verify such a claim. The idea brushes unashamedly with philosophical uncertainty. Whatever you do, don’t hold me to a solid position! We are either determined or everything is absolutely free; the latter usually constitutes a form of chaos which is self-evidently not true. The universe has order necessarily, but more so at differing localities. For brevity, metaphysically, order is of the nature of the Universe; physically, it is distributed unevenly, or quite disorderly. Tame that Universe.

		<title>Intelligible Propositions and their Relation to Infants</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2007/11/13/intelligible-propositions-and-their-relation-to-infants/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Propositions which cannot be subject to reason are categorically inappropriate; they should be dismissed. They’re sneaky, deceitful—and most people hardly even notice it! Since the question of God's existence can neither be proved nor disproved by virtue of what it means to be nonexistent (as the atheist will claim) in the first place or as "beyond this world" (as the theist will claim), the question is horribly meaningless—it falls under that inappropriate category.

The question Does God exist? and its various forms Do you believe in God? Is God necessary for morality? How about free will? etc all bear hidden, implicit assumptions that the subject of the question is even intelligible in the first place. It is not. 

You may as well ask, "Do you believe in this fancy neologism I've just invented?" 

However!— by definition of what atheism is—categorically dismissing the question as too unintelligible to be responded to does qualify one as an atheist. You are not an atheist because you've bested the theist with the evidential problem of evil or omnipotence paradoxes. You simply reject his or her notion of whatever they say they believe in on the grounds that it is simply makes no sense. Seriously, your question bears content which I cannot say I sufficiently comprehend to provide a reply. Do not fall prey to requesting an epistemic investigation of belief or philosophical inquiry into the ontological status of this “god” figure—ask them to provide a goddamn definition!

Now they may wish to justify their beliefs with this or that, but nowhere does "God" enter the picture. All justification for a belief is a rationalization which is, by definition, not faith. Under a religious context, anything but faith is not faith.

Noam Chomsky replied tersely and effectively to the question of his belief in God: Questioner: "Do you believe in God?" Chomsky: "I don't understand the question." 

Essentially, you're paying tribute to our beloved Socrates by standing firm and declaring that the inquirer defines his or her terms. Don't get caught in the trap of demanding that they prove it. If you do, you've taken their premise "God exists" as provisional. And if they're savvy enough, as unconscious charlatans usually can be, they can take the argument anywhere they please or just waste your time. Of course, they'd be doing both.

It is true that atheism must presuppose a theism in order to object it—to even be conceived as an intelligible term at that! If there were no theism, there would be no atheism. Atheism does not exist without a corresponding theism. 

I'm not sure how it follows that an infant not having a concrete, philosophical position would automatically qualify as a "theist." In what sense exactly? Are the theists to domineer now, too, in the domain of general spirituality? Are we to suppose theism and spirituality are equivalent? Why do we bother with these terms in the first place if they can so easily blur into each other as if they held no distinctions in the first place? I suppose it is the consequence of this notion of religious plurality and "anything goes" mentality. Woe to this postmodern world. It aches with the feeling of a disturbing descent into a messy communication breakdown.

The concept of "God" by any theist carries certain complex ethical implications, intellectual feats of understanding, and grandiose tales of jealousy (<em>human nature</em> appended to the bearer of <em>infinite wisdom</em>; as if that were not a shiningly overt contradiction) and chosen peoples trekking deserts with divine stamina and resilience. Can we disassociate all of this from the idea of God that we have come to understand and say that it exists within the mind of a child? What is it exactly that exists in the mind of a child? How can we assume that because people have a spiritual feeling that that feeling is equivalent to the proposition "God is all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good!"?

Atheism can either be strong or weak (explicit or implicit, active or passive, etc). Strong is usually the philosophical stance that includes also the weak stance. The weak stance, if it can be called a stance, is simply by definition the "lack of a belief in God or Gods". Properly understood, it means "lack of a belief in an idea". 

To assume that God is not an idea which must follow from a proposition first is to presuppose his existence as self-evident or true. But yet, we have to explain what it means to exist as self-evident but without discernible qualities. To say something is self-evident without elucidating the qualities of it that make it so is just an unjustified assertion. "God" could easily be replaced with "Blug!" But until we clarify what we mean and what constitutes “God,” the term is not intelligible. The idea is vacuous.

We must assume that God has qualities and things which distinguish it from other ideas, but it necessarily exists in the category of ideas. If God does not have discernible qualities which can only come forth through propositions, then we cannot say that the idea of God exists in anyone's mind anymore than the feeling to have a bowel movement comes when one has fully digested their food. Therefore, if a child cannot comprehend or express a proposition of an idea of God, then it follows that "God" is not a concept in their minds. Thus, they lack the belief in the idea of God, and general “spirituality” is but a mere correlate that we wish to join too earnestly with our own ideas of God. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Though it shimmers and turns about itself in the depths of our intellects, we let the world often tell us what surface pleasures are worth our attention.

It is curious how even to this day we allow present ignorance to govern our State and past ignorance to govern our Souls. And we are aware of it, or so we say. We find small battles to engage in while other spheres of the world's lives receive a shrug of the shoulder, yet even those are drenched in blood, treachery, flaw, enmity. I wonder at the nature of my fellows, and at myself—oh, how we can so arbitrarily choose certain goals in which to strive that would attain true "justice." There is a basis of faith which we are all chained up against.

When will it be that ignorance is not the true deity of this world? It is almost as if we must costume ourselves as rebels, as malcontents, for an empty sake—without rational justification; that is, cease to demand the hopelessness that evidence and reason fictitiously procure for your forward movement—so to have any desperate hope of attaining freedom. The most free and, consequently, the most wise, it seems, are those who live in the most feral states of nature.

		<title>Absolute Truth  God</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's an untrue assumption that "absolute truth" is equivalent to a religious person's God. This is self-evident by virtue of their being so many religious sects within denominations and religious groups. The question assumes that the atheist does not believe in objective moral standards or absolutes which can be true, false, or uncertain. You can be an atheist and believe in absolutes: Atheism is the rejection and-or lack of a belief in a deity or deities. This is why atheists can be accused of having dogmatic beliefs. Further, it is wrong to assume that belief in a deity is a necessary requirement to have moral views and that the deity itself is in fact the substratum for morality. This is obvious by virtue of the epistemological dilemma of knowing the deity's true nature. You can only assume the deity is moral in the way that you are moral or that religious groups are moral. Simply because a book says the deity is moral, it doesn't follow that the deity must be moral.

When atheists say "whatever makes me feel good," this is the same argument that the religious makes. It's a common sense one—it is such because all atheists and theists are agnostics. Indeed, it is necessary for a theist to be an agnostic for them to have religious belief. Belief and Knowledge are disparate domains. When we call a religious person a dogmatist, we do not mean: You have dogmatic and absolute views on what you Know. We mean: You have dogmatic and absolute views on what you Believe.

Religious people <em>believe they know</em> their deity's nature, but they do not know it. That being the case, they only believe their moral views are true, and this can be contested. Therefore, there is no reason to use the religious worldview as the default by which all questions of morality should be asked. There is no reason to assume their worldview true. Most people do this anyway, in their inquiries, because the popularity of religion and social coercion inclines them to do this.

		<title>Final Word on Definition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Of Atheism:</em>
<strong>1</strong> An atheist can only reject a deity or deities presented (as a definition of the deity) to her knowledge. This is what we call "strong atheism", "explicit atheism", or "philosophical atheism." 

<strong>2</strong> By definition of "belief," no person can believe, or have faith, in a deity which has not been presented to their knowledge. Their direction of faith would have no target (deity). This is what we call "weak atheism", "implicit atheism", or "default atheism." Can an uncivilized, remote island dweller have faith in the Christian God? This Islamic conception of the deity? The many manifestations of Brahma? Clearly this is not possible, for understanding of Scripture, Holy Writs, and of history and teaching are requirements to sufficiently execute worship proper. However, some wish to argue their deity as a "general spiritual force" or an everywhere present "spiritual energy." This will be discussed later.

<strong>2.1</strong> Atheism is the default stance of all persons existing in a world in which <em>at least one</em> theistic doctrine is held by <em>at least one</em> person. When all doctrines are ceased in so far as being held by persons capable of disseminating them, atheism thus becomes a meaningless stance. It is a stance only with respect to definitions of the deity. If no images of the deity are present, the atheist has nothing to reject or critique. In a possible world such as this, weak atheism then permeates throughout all persons.

<strong>3</strong> We cannot define a deity as a "general spiritual force" because this predicate is a necessary condition for the status of any possible conception of a deity as deity (or a divine entity). "General spiritual force" is not a signifier of any specific deity, but of all potential or actual conceptions of the deity. It is tautologous and possibly nihilistic—this will be discussed later.

<strong>4</strong> It is ethnocentric to assume that any single definition of the deity controls the spiritual feeling we all share as a species of sentient beings, but ethnocentricity occurs only if one grants that definitions of the deity cannot be severed from the culture in which it was contrived. A deity of a specific culture is as unique and as intellectually significant as the method of agriculture of that culture or the propensity of its constituents to grow to a certain average height. That is, the deity must have discernible qualities which define it and make it a target of faith. I could worship my human faculty to run a plow and garden, but all persons share this faculty with me as physical and sentient beings. No one will argue that our faculties as human beings come from our religious affiliations. The force by which we all thrive (as thinking, acting, desiring beings) as a species cannot be appropriated by any religious group. If it is argued, we are back at ethnocentrism and racism. This sort of mentality produced Nazism.

<strong>5</strong> If the deity is exactly a "general spiritual force," then by this definition (often haplessly used to save the deity as a moral force), all <em>tradition </em>and <em>culture </em> centered on the worship of the deity becomes meaningless and irrelevant. No arbitrary contrivance of human wit, history or culture can be appended to the notion of the deity; in truth, the deity being a "general spiritual force" destroys all human intellectual and creative connection to the deity. In truth, again, this argument destroys all purpose and meaning in human endeavors (a form of nihilism).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><strong>Science </strong>rushes headlong, without selectivity, without "taste," at whatever is knowable, in the blind desire to know all at any cost. Philosophical thinking, on the other hand, is ever on the scent of those things which are most worth knowing, the great and the important insights. [...] The <strong>philosopher </strong>seeks to hear within himself the echoes of the world symphony and to re-project them in the form of concepts. While he is contemplative-perceptive like the artist, compassionate like the religious, a seeker of purposes and causalities like the scientist, even while he feels himself swelling into a macrocosm, he all the while retains a certain self-possession, a way of viewing himself coldly as a mirror of the world.
—<em>Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks</em>, Nietzsche</blockquote>

<blockquote>When you say that if I deny, that the operations of seeing, hearing, attending, wishing, &c., can be ascribed to God, or that they exist in Him in any eminent fashion, you do not know what sort of God mine is; I suspect that you believe there is no greater perfection than such as can be explained by the aforesaid attributes. I am not astonished; for I believe that, if a triangle could speak, it would say, in like manner, that God is eminently triangular, while a circle would say that the divine nature is eminently circular. Thus each would ascribe to God its own attributes, would assume itself to be like God, and look on everything else as ill-shaped.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our bodies are perpetually biologically <em>conditioned </em>to certain vitamin and amino acid intakes, vaguely understood as based by the ever-changing combination thresholds brought about by the cumbrously gradual process we like to describe as "By Means of Natural Selection,"—that is, <em>not </em>to strictly eating the flesh of animals. If you wish to assume that vitamin supplements or unconventional dietary habits are "unnatural," then we may need to quibble over the definition of "nature," and possibly take up issue with unjustified ethnocentrism. If your definition of what is "natural" is what is conventionally done, then you have a pretty weak argument. I should not need to spell out why or give example as to how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum">argumentum ad populum</a> is a clear cut fallacy.

I am vegetarian because as far as meat goes, if I am to condone the consumption of animal flesh,—then homo sapiens sapiens are a subspecies of species within an <em>animal </em>kingdom! What is the animal? Are <em>we</em> the "animal" only in the laboratory and under the microscope? Society does not condone "human cannibalism,"—the dictionaries cannot decide consistently on a single either anthropocentric or unhelpfully general definition—and I particularly am not interested in eating my comrades. By that reasoning, I would not eat my <em>kingdom</em> fellows<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.

My stronger argument—one popularized by Peter Singer<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>—is that I'd prefer to eat something that did not, by definition of sentience, have to suffer any physical pain whatsoever to provide whatever <em>pleasure </em>I would receive from consuming it <em>or of it</em>. The robbing of eggs from hens or the possible psychological issue of captivity still disturb me, but my ignorance and misunderstanding of ethical theory pertaining to animals keeps me from full on veganism.

The defense for the consumption of meat is usually debated by means of <em>convenience </em>arguments or what's pleasurable. These are both unconvincing. Should anyone argue from a basic theory on human nature as dominant over or ontologically superior to that of animals—that's just plain bogus. Drop all affiliation with science (evolution) if you wish to employ such equivocation: Either you are <em>animal</em> or you are not. Don't turn to the Judeo-Christian Scripture for status leverage, for we find at Genesis 1:29:
<blockquote>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</blockquote>
It's been shown that vegetables, seeds, nuts, soy and so forth carry just as much nutritional value as dietary paths as the radical consumption<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> of meat. In any event, interpretation of Scripture does us no good for the truth of the matter. We've all got our exiguous but orgulous interpretations. We boil down to preference and social coercion. I merely advance that we should extinguish all pain where we see it. If we wish to assume that Human Pain is more severe and more "painful" than Animal Pain, then we've yet again assumed something that is not supported by the biological, psychological, and neurological sciences. Not that these silly fields of discourse are any basis for argument, truly, for they are only overelaborated ways of saying what we clearly observe in the moans and yelps of crawling creatures. Where do we get this human-centrist notion? Clearly it isn't an argument per se to call someone such, but can animals be degraded and disrespect so easily? I think not.

In truth, no side is more valid in its argument, and we find ourselves leaning to dispositions and mere preference.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chris Hedges' lecture was a long-winded moral argument for the existence of a certain conception of God (his own, whatever it may be) with tinges of the teleological argument for the existence of a certain conception of God.

Both are valid, but have false or uncertain premises. Therefore, the conclusions can follow validly, but the arguments can never be considered sound. That is, the arguments do not express truth. Rational argument for the existence of God as a moral force, considering the intimate—arguably inseparable—connection between God's essence and existence (expressed in discernible ways, such as a moral force), is unjustified in principle. Their premises can be disputed, and they are disputed. Indeed, the whole point of both arguments, or any argument for the existence of God, must show the truth of God's existence or essence without assuming God's essence (as proof) by some arbitrary attribute of God (power, love, etc). Otherwise, the argument is circular&mdash;not necessarily false but merely uninformative, unpersuasive. The nature of the epistemological uncertainty that we bear as to the premises makes both arguments circular, but they are valid only if you accept God-premises as true.

He argued for religious pluralism which he neither justified nor did he address openly. He merely asserted that all religious views are valid in so far as they are spiritual views which implies that religious tendencies or feelings are exactly the same as spiritual tendencies or feelings. The equating of these feelings, by definition of spiritual feelings, turns all verbal expression of religious feelings into unintelligible language lest it be assisted by whatever propagandist agenda.

He argued against "New Atheism," a form of atheism turned propaganda by public intellectuals like Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens. Hedges argued against Harris and "New Atheism" by challenging a hypothetical argument made by Harris which implicates one into a condoning position on the usage torture, [should] that person be unable to adequately argue against the hypothetical argument [based on his or her religious system]. Hedges implicated all New Atheist and all atheist moral systems into this argument (as condoning torture and in support of nuclear war). He never addressed any atheistic arguments or atheistic cultures living today.

He rejected Immanuel Kant's Enlightenment values (his racism), but used Kant's moral arguments in support of his (Hedges') own personal views.

He accepted that we must cherry pick the Scripture, and that certain passages are repugnant to reason. However, by implication of this, he should advocate no certain conception of God. God as a merely spiritual force cannot have a "will" in the sense that humans have a will. God as a Willing Agent is described in the Bible. The idea that a maximal spiritual force must essentially maintain a Will requires justification. If we can imagine any singular thing as not having a Will which constitutes its essence, then we can imagine a deity as not having a Will which constitutes its essence. Therefore, a Will is not an essential property of any conceivable thing. Thus, a Deity as a Willing Agent is not an absolute necessity. Any argument which asserts otherwise must justify that premise-assumption.

Hedges identifies himself as a Liberal Christian that gets disenfranchised by "New Atheists" and unfairly caricatured. Nonetheless, he identifies as "Christian," as a believer of God as a Willing Agent. This is an assertion that precludes anyone, should they believe it, from religious plurality. Greek thinkers, Buddhists, etc do not accept such bold assertions as the Infinite as a Willing Agent. Clearly from the basis of these differing systems of thought, plurality does not hold because disparate moral normative outlooks arise. Again, Hedges did not even justify his implicit argument for religious plurality, so clearly this is a merely mode of the Deus sive Nature, that being that all persons will have uniquely modified philosophical systems which do not adequately reflect the world view of any system or other individuals. Infinitely many modes flow from the essence of the absolutely infinite in infinitely many ways.

He further framed our failing world (Western) ethics as a consequence of the failed values of the Enlightenment. As already said, however, he cherry picked Kant. What is more, he oversimplified the scientific results of the Enlightenment and the purely economical factors which allowed for British Empiricism, a mere philosophical school, to prevail and represent much, if not most, of progressive Europe. The values were not dropped or given up: It's only that the Empiricists did not agree with Continental Rationalism as expressed by Descartes and Leibniz, who indeed argued for religious ideology, faith, human equality. Hedges grossly  misrepresented Enlightenment values by his massive generalization that suggests his ignorance of that which he argues against.

He eventually brought in Spinoza to defend his argument that "atheism of yesterday is the religion of today." Spinoza never considered himself an atheist, but his Jewish community did. So we have a difference in opinion even at the source that to this day is still researched and debated by Jewish scholars. We can only conclude ignorance on Hedges' part, or that he was using Spinoza's plight as a tool to spread his personal views. In either case, respect on his views of atheism should not be granted in so far as his argument pertaining to "atheism as a social movement"; that is, it's a red herring in so far as it's used to debate with atheism per se.

When Spinoza was mentioned, I had to leave. It's insulting to see philosophers' and great thinkers' names used as rhetorical tools, but it's even worse when it is someone as wildly misunderstood and enigmatic as Spinoza.

The entire lecture was stacked with straw men arguments, but I believe his aim, either known or unknown (consciously unable; he doesn't know what atheism actually is) by him, was never to attack atheism itself. However, his implied moral and teleological arguments suggest that he does not agree with atheism in so far as atheistic persons, by lacking observance of a deity either overtly or unknowingly, do not derive moral understanding from a deity or any deity.

<strong>Original Question:</strong>
If the atheist purports that a practical and naturalistic morality without a god is possible just as a practical morality with a god is possible, what is the disadvantage of having a society live by either standards? The truth of the existence of the god aside, and if we can confine ourselves to a pragmatic observation of the question: What practical value does defending a personal conception of god provide if both moral systems produce the same results?

Someone before me asked a possibly philosophical question which pertains to the effects of language in the midst of the battle between religion and the caricatured ideology of popular Enlightenment philosophers as harmful to humanity. How is language used as a propagandist tool? How is religious language and scientific nomenclature used to coerce beliefs on either side of the debate?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Proposition 5 of Ethics</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2008/01/25/proposition-5-of-ethics/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This proposition is ambiguous and its demonstration difficult to accept; however, it is the basis for demonstration for many subsequent propositions. I believe its demonstration is crucial to the whole of Ethics, but only in so far as one requires strict proof-solutions, or at least the chapter in which it rests. I will here attempt to study it, but we must keep in mind that the rest of the Ethics can still be understood intelligibly and used instructively even if some of its proofs are not valid. Even Bertrand Russell says that the Propositions can be read without drudging through the Demonstrations.
<hr />
<blockquote>P5: In Nature there cannot be two or more substances of the same nature <em>or</em> attribute.</blockquote>

<strong>Demonstration:</strong> If there were two or more distinct substances, they would have to be distinguished from one another either by a difference in their attributes, or by a difference in their affections (by P4). If only by a difference in their attributes, then it will be conceded that there is only one of the same attribute. But if by a difference in their affections, then since a substance is prior in nature to its affections (by P1), if the affections are put to one side and [the substance] is considered in itself, that is (by D3 and A6), considered truly, one cannot be conceived to be distinguished from another, that is (by P4), there cannot be many, but only one [of the same nature <em>or</em> attribute], QED.

Antecedents:

D3: By substance I understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, that is, that whose concept does not require the concept of another thing, from which it must be formed.

A6: A true idea must agree with its object.

P1: A substance is prior in nature to its affections.

P2: Two substances having different attributes have nothing in common with one another. (For my purposes.)

P4: Two or more distinct things are distinguished from one another, either by a difference in the attributes of the substances or by a difference in their affections.
<hr />
<strong>Thoughts:</strong>
1 If two distinct substances exist, upon perceiving those substances (by D4), a distinction between them can only be made through appealing to their Attributes or through their Affections (which are the Modes, or <em>ways</em>, in which an Attribute is itself perceived of the substance; all by P4).
2 If one takes the former approach to distinguish the substances by an Attribute, presupposing that they do in reality bear different Attributes in order to distinguish them, then the substances must be understood as not having the same Attribute. Indeed, from this case, the distinction cannot be made because in order to distinguish the substances through an Attribute, supposing that an attempt at distinguishing presumes that the Attributes are exclusive identities and not the same in nature, they would have to have something in common. But they would not have anything in common (by P2). Therefore, if they have different Attributes, as stated, only one of them can be ("there is only one of the same attribute"). That is, one substance will be the only substance in so far as attempting to perceive its distinction from other substances because its distinction by distinguishing it presupposes that it is already distinct.

Simply: If their Attributes are different, then they cannot be distinguished from one other by those Attributes because their difference is already established in principle (by P2); they have no commonality thus no mutual Attribute. 

This seems like it is unhelpful to distinguish them by their Attributes alone. We must look to their affections.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In PDF form: <a href='http://nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/misreading-spinoza.pdf' title='misreading-spinoza.pdf'>misreading-spinoza.pdf</a>

As I was reading through Chapter 14 of The Courtier and the Heretic: <em>Leibniz, Spinoza, and the Fate of God in the Modern World</em>, I noticed and reflected upon a reoccurring notion not only limited to the literature I had before me: that Spinoza is Naturalizing God or Deifying Nature. Leibniz, Spinoza's immediate colleague and debating partner during the November month of 1676, too, took this to be Spinoza's aim. The author of The Courtier and the Heretic, Matthew Stewart, flirts with the idea as well. Indeed, it seems to almost every interpretation of Spinoza that I read, this hypothesis stirs up without fail. The general idea Stewart has in mind, as expressed by two explicitly made but not yet expounded upon arguments, is that Spinoza's aim was chiefly political: Spinoza wished to undermine the orthodox tradition of overarching authority. In my mind, to set out to "disrobe God" or to tack on "divinity" to nature would be largely a political move. From this, the claim is that Spinoza was more so interested in a "transvaluation" of all values more so than demonstrating, however rigorously he could, the true nature of Deus, Sive Natura [God, that is to say, Nature]  (I paraphrase Definition 6 of Chapter 1 of the Ethics:),

<blockquote>[that being] absolutely infinite, maintaining an infinity of attributes, each of which expresses its infinite and eternal essence.</blockquote>

More importantly, he says in the subsequent corresponding Explication:

<blockquote>I say absolutely infinite, not infinite in its own kind. If we say [that being] is infinite in its own Kind, then we can prevent certain attributes from pertaining to its True Essence.</blockquote>

Indeed, this seems like a digression into self-gratifying recollection of the master's idea; but I think it is unjustly overlooked, this crucial definition, when philosophers, dimwits, scientists and charlatans attempt to "pin down" what Spinoza thought of God. They fall prey to their presupposing and imposing interpretation of an [external] doctrine in their own terms. Right by their side, Spinoza joins in the attack against Science or the attack against God. The author of The Courtier and the Heretic joins in, claiming that Spinoza's understanding of God is best "understood in the negative." Spinoza is "best" understood by contrasting his doctrines with the standard, the conventional, the orthodox. I feel this argument presupposes a (political) agenda for Spinoza by portraying his system as best understood from the negative. I think Spinoza's system is best understood in its positive aspects: absolutely infinite, necessity of all things, dogs and men as modes, and all that. It's tantalizing and difficult work understanding Deus sive Natura, but as Spinoza says "All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare." Merely because it is understand best by us "in the negative," this does not sufficiently support the argument that Spinoza had a personal vendetta or political agenda outside of describing to the followers of reason what God's nature necessarily is. Indeed, Spinoza is just talking about really opaque stuff.

But of course, to the Scientific mind today, Spinoza is "Naturalizing God", in so far as the Scientific mind debates with the Theologian from Source work; and to the Theologian today, Spinoza is "Deifying Nature", in so far as the Theologian claws for an attempt to destroy the Scientist's Spinozistic leaning. It is an incorrect assumption for these intellectual brutes to ever believe that Spinoza’s God’s true essence is ever Nature or God exactly. No, these are but attributes, and an attribute is "what the intellect perceives of a substance."

We must understand this seemingly forgotten or never truly observed (by our opponents) Definition 6 of the first Chapter of the Ethics. To ask: Is he dirtying up the divine, or is he exalting the dirt? Well, we have a meaningless question, and you have no attended to the arguments or notions of the work correctly. Spinoza is doing neither: He is speaking of God, or Nature proper.

"Deus <em>sive</em> Natura." Spinoza was called "our Jew" by Leibniz, "that odd [Jew] philosopher", "apostate Jew", "the Atheist Jew", Jew-this, Jew-that. Never have I seem such casual prejudice looming beneath the thoughts of great thinkers as if it were argument itself. Perhaps it is merely a form of referential endearment to consistently take note of his ethnic background. But even today, it seems the most any philosopher can say of Spinoza is either "Who?" or "He was that Jew, right?" What has any of this to do with his works? This seems to be the doorway into [my] argument that Spinoza has gone unduly unnoticed by the population at large. Obscure and esoteric philosophers, marginalized by the Western (analytic) tradition, chant loudly but unheard into the ears of positivists and Wittgensteinians who demand the conformity to Language as the God of Man. We've taken the God of old and turned Him into a patriarchal phenomenalistic linguist. And anything Spinoza has to say, in the rigorous Doctor's mind, is precious or just a silly mode. It must be Nature or it must be God&mdash;the embattled theologians and philosopher-scientists continue.

"Deus <em>sive</em> Nature." Seymour Feldman, editor and writer of the introduction of Samuel Shirley's translation of the Ethics, treats us to an enlightening explanation of much of the nomenclature Spinoza radically redefines throughout the course of his masterwork. Introduction, Definition 8. Sive or Seu reads:

<blockquote>The orthodox translation of these Latin words is 'or.' Spinoza nearly always uses them to indicate an alternative expression for what he is trying to say, and this in fact gives us a valuable insight into the interlocking of concepts that characterises his system. But the English 'or' is frequently disjunctive; e.g. you can travel by this road or by that. So the unvarying translation of sive (seu) by 'or' can be quite misleading.
I have therefore usually translated it by 'that is' when it implies equivalence. When Spinoza uses 'hoc est,' which he frequently does, I also translate as 'that is.'</blockquote>

Now this may seem quite trivial. Spinoza says that through Science you find God or through, say, the Church you find God. These are both just alternative routes to the same end. To stay true to Spinoza's system, in the words "Deus sive Natura," we see that both terms are Attributes. They are each one of the infinite Attributes which constitute the essence of God or Nature.

When we think of "traveling this road or that road," do we find that in going these disjunctive routes we witness the exact same sorts of trivial objects and environments? If I travel down path A, supposedly alternative to path B, do I expect to see the exact same sorts of things I would see as if traveling down path B? Of course not; I have taken a different route. From the perspective of someone, say, a scientist, on path A, even if it is remarkably similar to path B, that scientist will not see exactly that which, say, a theologian sees on path B.

So did Spinoza turn God into a Scientist, or did he turn the world into a soul, a spirit, the divine? Did he naturalize God, or did he deify Nature? The question is a false start.

At the level of language "deus" is a term used to reference either an object or an idea. This is what words do, as no one will contest. For Spinoza, Axiom 6 reads,

<blockquote>A true idea must agree with its object.</blockquote>

Clearly, within the confines of his system, God "agrees with" Nature. In the strictest way, God is Nature in the way that the number 4 written down on a piece of paper agrees with the idea of number four thought in one's mind. If never written down, the number 4, in so far as whatever potential arithmetical application goes, does not exist. But when it is written down, in so far as whatever potential arithmetical application goes, it does (until it is erased; but even some marks of it still remain). Now, consider of all the number 4s in the world: This would be God, in so far as this crude analogy attempts to illustrate. God is every idea agreeing with every object; that is, as applied as Nature is in so far as it exists, God exists in so far as it [God] agrees with Nature. Take away Nature, take away God.

Back at the language level "deus" references either "God" or it references "Nature". However, by A6, "deus" references to both. It works not unlike an inclusive OR statement. The same goes for "natura"; this is evident given what has just been demonstrated. Now, when someone says "the Kingdom of God" they either mean the kingdom of God is in God or it is outside of God in so far as God's power over that kingdom. When we say "deus" we either refer to a transcendental (orthodox) or immanent (Spinozist) God. We could say, when someone passes away, "He is with God now" which would be synonymous with saying "He is in the Kingdom of God now." The message would be conveyed necessarily with both utterances. From this, as far as the communicated idea goes, the "Kingdom of God" is synonymous with "God" itself. In any event, at least, we can say that both concepts are applicable and thus efficient signifiers for God.

To the point: What is divine? Either "deus" is a referential term for all things divine or it is not. If the former, it must be granted that when someone says a thing is "divine" in the religious sense, they mean it is directly related to God's divine nature. That is, a divine cup would be divine because it mutually shares the divine nature with God. God may bestow its own nature on the cup, and God may not be on the same ontological level as the cup in so far as it and the cup partake of the divine attribute. But nonetheless, each (God or divine cups) would be described by the word "divine" in so far as they each share divine attributes (supposing one accepts doctrines such as transubstantiation  and not nonsensical, figurative symbolic materialism). Therefore, when I take action or an affected by supposed action of divine things, I could say that I was "affected by the divine" or, equally understood, "I was affected by God." 

If the latter, then this would be that there are divine things outside of "deus" or God. This would mean that we could possibly refer to something as divine but its transcendent quality would either come from within it or from some external means. If God is not the source of all divine things, then divine things are either divine because of themselves or because of something else. If the former, then clearly this contradicts Scripture for:

<blockquote>Ex 20:3-4 "You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below."</blockquote>

Indeed, it seems that God dictates that the possibility of divine things having a source other than God is actually impossible. Therefore, God is the totality of divine things. When we have a divine cup, we could say, "I have a Godly cup" or "I have a cup of God." It would be the same as saying "I have a divine cup".

From this, we see that "deus", "God", "divinus", "divine" are all interchangeable referential terms for the same idea which, by A6, must agree with its object. And finally, we must conclude that we Spinoza says "Deus, sive Natura" he does not mean "Judeo-Christian God as the Jews and Christians understand it or Nature". He in fact means "the totality of divine thing or the totality of natural things". God or "deus", in effect, becomes merely a referential term for the totality of divine things, whatever those divine things may be, not a certain conception of "God" as a contrast to Nature.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday in my "<a href="http://nerdfiles.net/2008/01/25/proposition-5-of-ethics/">Proposition 5 of Ethics</a>" entry, I attempted to shed some light on my own understanding of the crucial demonstration of that proposition. In fact, it is so crucial, I form three contentions:

<strong>1</strong> that the whole of Spinoza's demonstration in the Ethics for substance monism depends on the clear and sound exposition of that proposition;

<strong>2</strong> that should we take Leibniz's response to the accusation of his own Spinozism at face value, found in a certain correspondent letter, proposition 5's proof decisively determines whether or not "He would be right, if there were no Monads." That is, in Leibniz's metaphysics, the world is constituted by a infinite quatity of infinitely complex substances called Monads. Their proposition exists as a direct contrast to the possibility of a single infinitely complex substance.

<blockquote>On the contrary, it is precisely by means of the monads that Spinozism is destroyed. For there are as many true substance&mdash;as many living mirrors of the Universe, always subsisting, as it were, or concentrated Universes&mdash;as there are Monads; whereas, according to Spinoza, there is but one sole substance. He would be right, if there were no Monads.
&mdash;Letter to Bourguet, 1714</blockquote>

<strong>3</strong> We see that Proposition 5 concerns itself solely with our relation, in so far as our intellect can distinguish between them, to Substance qua substances or Monad qua substances. Fundamentally, Substance and Monad are the same concept; whereas one Substance constitutes Spinoza's metaphysical outlook, infinitely many Monads (Substances) constitute Leibniz's metaphysical outlook.

<strong>3.1</strong> It seems apparent that the difference between Substance Monism and Monadology is essentially epistemological. That is, regardless of their inconsistent truth values, can we ever know the conclusions of the doctrines per se or even distinguish between them?]]></content:encoded>

Are you a Hebrew? Are you one of the first Roman Christians? A Christian lawful to Jewish customs and tradition? Is this your century or theirs? Are these your politics or theirs? Your ethics or theirs? Where does the materialism and piety of your faith end and the true worship of your faith begin?

<blockquote>As for the Christian rites, such as baptism, the Lord's Supper, festivals, public prayers, and any other observances which are, and always have been, common to all Christendom, if they were instituted by Christ or His Apostles (which is open to doubt), they were instituted as external signs of the universal church, and not as having anything to do with blessedness, or possessing any sanctity in themselves. Therefore, though such ceremonies were not ordained for the sake of upholding a government, they were ordained for the preservation of a society, and accordingly he who lives alone is not bound by them: nay, those who live in a country where the Christian religion is forbidden, are bound to abstain from such rites, and can none the less live in a state of blessedness.
<strong>&mdash;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Benedictus de Spinoza; pg. 76</strong></blockquote>

The Judaeo-Christian Scripture says nothing of going to the blocky brick and mortar, putting on a tie, and worshipping this or that many times a week. However, we can take from Scripture that the first Christians met <em>at least once </em>a week. What was their reasoning for meeting <em>at least once </em>a week? Let's take a stab at it.

<blockquote>2:37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?	
2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.
2:40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.	
2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.	
2:42 <strong>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship</strong><sup>1</sup>, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.	
2:43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.	
2:44 <strong>And all that believed were together, and had all things common</strong><sup>2</sup>;
2:45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.
2:46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread <strong>from house to house</strong><sup>3</sup>, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,	
2:47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.
<strong>&mdash;The Acts 2:38-47</strong></blockquote>

The Jews went to synagogue routinely. We'll concede any argument that Christians were just playing it up like Jews. So all religions do some routine (and traditional) activities? Not our issue right now, aside from it being implicit arguments for universal materialism which all the (superstitiously) religious wish to deny&mdash;but like I said, not our issue. So the Christians picked up some habits.

<strong>1</strong> If you were given a chance to speak to God directly and ask as many questions as you like, as if to a wise master, would it be morally <em>wrong</em> of God to allow you to run out of questions?

<strong>1.1</strong> The assumption is that no one, not even the authors of the Scripture, understands the teaching of God with absolute accuracy.

<strong>1.2</strong> The interesting question is this: From where does the attrition to accuracy in a message originate? Is it with the speaker or is it with the listener? Can we even ask if God would be morally right or wrong to let one cease inquiry because of the flaw in human nature? Is it morally wrong for us to not learn how to generate newer and better questions after we've attained the knowledge to previous ones, given that God only answers the questions we directly ask? Elementum: There is a relationship between Morality and present Knowledge. What is it? Which precedes, if they are not temporally parallel? That is, can (negative) moral judgments be made against one bearing insufficient knowledge? Must morally right actions follow from sufficient knowledge? Can we even play deductive waltz with concepts such as these? (Are they invalid questions?)

<strong>1.21</strong> Back to the original question:

<blockquote>Whence it follows, that if anyone wishes to teach a doctrine to a whole nation (not to speak of the whole human race), and to be understood by all men in every particular, he will seek to support his teaching with experience, and will endeavour to suit his reasonings and the definitions of his doctrines as far as possible to the understanding of the common people, who form the majority of mankind, and he will not set them forth in logical sequence nor adduce the definitions which serve to establish them. Otherwise he writes only for the learned&mdash;that is, he will be understood by only a small proportion of the human race.
<strong>&mdash;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Benedictus de Spinoza; pg. 77</strong></blockquote>

<strong>2</strong> "And all that <em>believed</em> were together, and had all things <em>common</em>"

<strong>2.1</strong> When you stand in Church, spinning circles and twirling about, are you absolutely certain those who stand next to you believe in exactly the same idea or conception of God that you believe in?

<strong>2.11</strong> Aside from the epistemological can of worms I just opened up, we can take an easy path. No, it’s not exactly the same idea or conception, but it only varies in degree, not kind. Is someone standing next to me, as they sing praise and vomit the rhetoric of the Council of Nicaea, actually believing in the same God I believe in, just in a different flavor?

<strong>2.12</strong> However, attend to that thought: Is it possible for someone to be standing next to you who does actually not believe in the same idea or conception of God as you? Can we translate the verb "believe" into a distinguishable action? Is spitting rhetoric what one does when he or she "believes?" How about drinking from a divine cup? Is that "believing" in action?

<strong>2.13</strong> The biggest question here is: How do you know? If you do not know, then we have a dilemma. Are you assembling with possible serial killers and soccer moms as an expression of faith in your fellows or in God? Is assembling an expression of faith in man or faith in God? Can it be both?

<strong>2.14</strong> I suppose the religious person would answer, "By expressing faith in God, I am therefore safe to do whatever it is I want amongst men without worry." That's an easy answer. Anything follows from a contradiction; anything follows from the infinite. This will be discussed later.

<strong>2.2</strong> Do you have anything in common with those worshipping with you?

<strong>2.21</strong> Can a Jew, a Muslim, and a Christian worship together? What does it mean to have commonality amongst beliefs? Can you argue for "general spirituality" while still maintaining arbitrary worship practises and pagan rituals?

<strong>3</strong> There's no justification for traveling to a "building of worship" from the Scripture. Any location can be a place of assembly. Acts 19:9-10 shows up that synagogues or schools could function as places of worship as well. Anyone demanding that one must "attend church" must justify why church and not one's own house.

<strong>3.1</strong> If the justification is "more people gather there" or anything similar, then one must reconcile "collective faith" with "personal faith." Does it concern God whether or not you worship in an arbitrary body of common beliefs or amongst your immediate family? Or by yourself in your own kitchen? It seems like the whole slew of potential answers are but mere<em> preferences.</em>

<blockquote>10:24 And let us <strong>consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works</strong><sup>1</sup>:
10:25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
<strong>&mdash;Hebrews 10:24-25</strong></blockquote>

<strong>1</strong> If you find that assembling with your family or fellows is stressful (contrasted with promoting you to love and do good works) for you, does the Scripture provide you with a sufficient means to endure that stress beyond merely asserting that you succumb to hierarchical obedience? This would be nonsense, if one answers that it does not while maintaining that one must still submit to Strength. Must children presuppose their parents will follow Scripture accordingly?

<blockquote>And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
<strong>&mdash;Ephesians 6:4</strong></blockquote>

Or must parents presume their children will follow the Decalogue? 

<blockquote>Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth 
<strong>&mdash;Exodus 20:12</strong></blockquote>

Children typically do not have much say in the matter of how they will be instructed. So clearly the weight of the struggle for a proper, moral upbringing rests primarily on the parent. What's concerning is the ambiguity in obeying an authority whose power has been legitimized without the child's consent. How exactly is that authority established; how is it made sovereign? This reminds me of a criticism of <a href="http://www.mises.org/etexts/longanarchism.pdf">question begging</a> made against social contract theory. What is the relationship between material upbringing, sovereignty, honor of one's parents, and true worship? If you accept the theory of the social contract, as opposed to a Spinozistic theory of capacity to desire as the only foundation of one's rights, then would be required of individuals involved need be fully conscious and understanding of their relationship under their contract? Can a child be fully conscious and understanding of its binding relationship with a presupposedly legitimized sovereign power? It seems like the social contract is disturbed when it meets the door to the household. Is it disturbed at the state as well? Is the social contract (growing toward sovereignty) compatible with Divine Fiat Systems (automatic/arbitrary sovereignty)?

Scripture tells us that the father derives his status from God itself. 

<blockquote>3:14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
3:15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
<strong>&mdash;Ephesians 3:14-15</strong></blockquote>

Therefore, the father's authority is either divine or it is not. This can be said without granting that the father himself is divine, but only the binding contract between, say, a father and his son. The divine quality of authority comes from the causal connection between a God's decree to the father's decree and down to the offspring. If you take the father's decrees to not be divine, then you tacitly argue that God's fiats are thus not divine. This is a less interesting stance for our case here. So the father's edicts are divine and sovereign through a non-consensual binding contract. Thus, the child under the father must exercise faith in God through the proxy of the father. This is the understanding implicit in the Decalogue's commandment to "Honor thy [parents]". 

However, this is clearly absurd. If we, as children of parents, blindly apply this ambiguous and overly simplistic fiat, we preclude the possibility of children refusing abhorrent derivative Christian philosophies such as that of the KKK and other Christian terrorist groups. No, the argument here is not to blame Christianity for the ills of the world. The argument is that it is absurd, being born into this precarious and chaotic situation, some like to describe as “the best possible”, to follow Scripture, written by fallible men, that could not have foreseen the explosion of derivative philosophies which stem from it. The issue is not "Christianity is bad because the KKK is bad." The issue is: How do I make intelligible the notion of honoring a fallible person? If the answer is: Have faith in the divine chain, then you've submitted your defeat to the volatile world which seemingly can easily destroy you.

<strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong>

Beyond all of what has just been said, we must look at the tone and basis for these recommendations on how to worship. These high priests are not asserting that "in order to worship God [and thus, if you're a Christian, to be moral], you must assemble." The idea that piety and morality have some sort of relationship is false. Piety does not produce a moral person, and piety is necessarily constrained to superfluous religious practices. 

What was Saint Peter's justification for these practices?&mdash;Don't act superstitious. Peter needed the same sort of reasoning we need today for any sort of act we make. The high priest was merely recommending what he perceived to be the best means of expressing faith amongst the pagan Romans, given what limited intellects they possessed. Furthermore, they needed to appeal to the lesser intellects of their followers. So they submitted simple and general practices to their followers which would be difficult to argue against. In any case, however, these were recommendations to ancient Christians, not authoritative guidelines binding for the rest of eternity. If you are a Christian and you read them as such, you are a Jew. The arbitrary claims of putting on expensive slacks, driving to a building <em>even once</em> a week, and eating kosher foods are but one person's opinion on how to worship. 

<blockquote>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
<strong>&mdash;Matthew 18:15</strong></blockquote>

Verses such as this suggest that the only requirement of a proper assembly is that a multitude of persons be gathered in God's name. Perhaps some trivial questions could be asked of this. What is "God's name?" Like with my previous epistemological issue, the question is not "Can we all believe in the same idea exactly?" but "As we stand together, can you know if I believe in the same idea in just the same way you believe in it?" In what important ways do ideas differ? Does the configuration, or unique identity, of a mind establish exclusivity between itself and other minds to all concepts, all potentially apprehended ideas? Can we become fully conscious of a mutual acquisition of presupposed common notions?

If we cannot know, then we are expressing a certain faith in man, not God. Why? The intentions of man surreptitiously immoral are of a more immediate concern to your well-being. You do not rally and worship amongst men in strip clubs and at the shopping mall. You need to know if someone is going to harm you. If you deny this (which already has evidence in support of the claim that you do not deny it; you built your own "safe house" of worship), then we have defeatism in the face of man for asinine and blind faith in God, taking the blunt of every ill and hateful action that man can toss your way. You do not live this way: Face it. You are clannish and bigoted; worship at home&mdash;<em>worship in yourselves.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[<strong>Date of Entry: 01-28-2008</strong>] In honor and thanks to the Epictetian spiritual practice of <em>logos</em> (logic), let's begin.

<blockquote>If thou art pained by any external thing, it is not this that disturbs thee, but thy own <em>judgment</em> about it. And it is in thy <em>power</em> to wipe out this judgment now. [my emphasis]
<strong>&mdash;<em>Meditations</em>, Marcus Aurelius (121-180); Emperor of the Roman Empire, 2<sup>nd</sup> cen. CE</strong></blockquote>

<strong>1</strong> "Some things are up to us and some are not up to us."

<strong>1.1</strong> The classification of "things." Dualistic; ontological assignment of a nature to "things." This is the point of contact between things: Us, persons involved with <em>this</em> or <em>that</em> thing, granted that some are the former and some are the latter. (We necessarily encounter some of the former and some of the latter.) Our main concern is how do We make these things relate to one another to form a cohesive world.

<strong>1.11</strong> Do these "things" of distinct ontological classes exist without prevalence or metaphysical superiority to the other in so far as they affect Us? Does my Desire's ability to affect me prevail in affecting me over my Possessions' ability to affect me? Is it fallacious to suppose my Desire's superiority in the larger metaphysical scheme over my Possession's affection given that neither terms' ontological prevalence has been determined?

<strong>1.12</strong> Assertion: "I have my own without understanding why or how I have my own." Does a posteriori knowledge support the claim "My Desire precedes my Possessions in affecting me"? Can I look at a woman and say, "She seems to have prevailed against this or that thing. She must have her own against those types of things. Look, there again, she does the same thing in prevailing." What faculty of hers dictates which will prevail, her physical makeup or her presupposed "will" to prevail? Moral: When I look at this situation, what faculty of my own dictates how I will perceive it. What determines how I will subsume it into my own knowledge as "She prevailed because of her will" or "She prevailed because of her physical makeup"? Can any a posteriori observation I make establish that what allowed her to prevail was Absolute Will or Absolute Physical Power?

<strong>1.2</strong> "Our opinions are up to us, and our impulses, desires, aversions&mdash;in short, whatever is our own doing."

<strong>1.21</strong> Establishment of Free Will. What does this assumption establish for the identity of a human being? When we speak of "us" or an individual, what has this assumption framed or constructed as the "individual"?

<strong>1.3</strong> "Our bodies are not up to us, nor are our possessions, our reputations, or our public offices, or, that is, whatever is not our own doing."

<strong>1.31</strong> If our physical bodies are not up to us, then what defines the individual identity? Is it the totality of its features which make it distinguishable against other identities? Clearly, for this doctrine, "our own" or our "identity" is not distinguishable by our physical existence. Our identity&mdash;that which makes us unique and capable of having "up to us" power&mdash;must be non-material. It follows that Stoicism is precluding any sort of materialistic determinism. The deterministic outlook must be either logical or immaterial.

<strong>1.32</strong> If something like the bearing of "our public office" is not our own doing, then either the endeavor to attain a public office is not our own doing or the relation of one's self to the function of a public office&mdash;"I have a public office, and I am related to that public office's function which produces this or that effect"&mdash;is not our own doing. The concept "public office" presumes a function in order to constitute its own identity. We would have "I" related to "Public Office" in some discernible way. A major assumption that can be addressed is: Does the Stoic "I" serve a function or presume a function for itself? 

<strong>1.33</strong> We reach an issue of connecting identities. When the Stoic says "I have a public office", does the Stoic mean "I" as a unique, impenetrable identity such as something which is radically free (able to say "I have my absolute own")? [<strong>Added 01-29-2008:</strong> In a linguistic sense, is the Stoic saying "I" as a Referential Subject or a Referential Object? Is this "I" a Processional Subject or a Static Subject?" In the statement "I own this" is there a supposition that I do in fact own it now or that, upon reflection of the history of my memories, I own it in so far as my memories persuade me? In essence, am I Being or Becoming? Let's say, as you make a statement, the world, in an instant, accelerates forward by 1 year. Do the contents of your declaration reflect the world as you understand it at time 1 (T1; 1=1 day) or at time 2 (T365)? The point of the inquiry, should the acceptance of the hypothetical stand, is to understand how declarations relate to memory. Is memory an accurate reflection of the world. Could it be that the world only seems to skip to time 2 in an instant? If accepted: Can the memory be an inaccurate reflection of the world at, say, time 3 (0.02 seconds after a declaration is made)? It seems we must assume anyone is accurate in their declarations or assertions without proper basis for doing so.] Or, does the Stoic mean "I" as a reference to the relational that some thing has a "public office" and "I" happen to also be related to that referential "I". That is, the Stoic says to the mirror, "There I am having a Public Office, but that is not Me ("I"). That is only me in the referential sense. What I am is not what defines or situates Me in the world of relations."

<strong>1.34</strong> So, does the Absolute "I" presume a function? Does it require a function in order to exist as an identity? Can an "I" simply Be (as in maintaining Being) without being understood (distinguished) through a relation (as having a function)? Does "I" necessarily presume or involve some sort of function or action? When I say "I" does my utterance tacitly assert "I am"? Elementum: Do identities exist in themselves or do they necessarily involve a relational aspect? If the former, then true freedom is granted. If the latter, then the identity must be precluded from true freedom because the identity is always related, always functioning. Can the Stoic say in any meaningful way "I am an Absolute Identity which bears True Freedom?" without being understood as part of a relational scheme? Epistemologically speaking, can we understand (and subsume into our Knowledge) the utterance "I"? What does it mean to say "I am truly free" as it unrelated to all else? Must freedom presuppose or react against that which constrains and impedes?

<strong>1.35</strong> "I own myself against a determined world." This claim puts one as a unique identity in the world. Either one is constrained to Nature or one is not. If you are constrained to Nature, can you own yourself in Nature? Is it Absolute Freedom or Relative (Striving Toward) Freedom? Is the belief in the latter what bridges one with the former? If one is not constrained to Nature, can one exist harmoniously with it? Can one live in accord with Nature? What is the Stoic's say to this? Live in accord with the logos or universal reason.

<strong>Notes on General Stoicism</strong>

1 Epictetus school - logic -> ethics -> physics

1.1 Physical principles never taught as first principles when presented under ethical teaching.

1.2 Epictetus does not assume knowledge of physics yet knowledge of ethics cannot be complete until later physics training becomes complete.

1.3 Only reason or logical faculty is capable of making "value judgments." Reason determines the proper use of all other faculties.

1.4 "use of appearances" is the judgement, or opinions of value, one makes of a thing, not sense experience general.

1.41 How we relate external objects to our Desires and Impulses, test their validity, the way we receive the appearance. No action is involve with the thing which appears to us.

1.5 "Since things beyond our control are not pertinent to our moral conduct, the whole of ethics is limited to the use of appearances, which alone is in our power; and, since the correct use of appearances is a logical function of man, the whole of ethics is a function of logic." [De Lacy, P. "The Logical Structure of the Ethics of Epictetus"]

1.6 The assumption is that we are endowed with reason&mdash;rationality is part of the human condition. For Epictetus, if this assumption is granted, then it follows that man has a faculty for the use of appearances. Thus, one is morally wrong only if one does not employ the use of appearance-judgement.

1.61 However, he steps beyond this assumption to claim we are more "akin" to God because we have reason. The assumption is further that animals do not have rationality. In what sense do we have rationality?

1.7 Irrational use of appearance leads to unhappiness.

1.8 Subtract all Desire to external objects since they are assumed to be outside of our governance essentially. We may believe we've attained them, but we never attain them absolutely. We never control them as if we control ourselves; our hands, even, are bounded by the physical limitations; but what of our rationality? Our reason? Do our opinions have restrictions on them exactly the same way our bodies have restrictions?

1.9 Happiness becomes independent of external things. Happiness increases as one focuses on the progression of those things within one's control. Naturally, abstaining from externals allows one to harness "one's own", thus increasing one's virtue. The formula is simple: Virtue = ( Avoidance / Impulse ) or ( Aversion / Desire ). W.r.t. an external object, an increasing avoidance leads to greater Virtue since Avoidance and Impulse are inversely proportional.

1.91 Once the quality of an object is put in the use of appearance of the individual, the idea is that abstaining or avoiding that object enhances ones skill or strength to aver from desires.

2 "He lives calmly and peacefully, for he knows that objects beyond his will are nothing to him." The issue is not not the superficial rejection of externals; the issue is, given the Power through Identity principle, what one cannot assert full governance over must not be strived for since the possibility exists that it can be lost. The whole of nature is stronger than we are, and only its laws dictate which natures can necessarily govern other natures.

3 Mediate and immediate knowledge.

4 Nothing outside our power is good or evil.

5 use of appearance is reflexive. you can apply it to self

6 Chrysippus - physics -> logic and ethics

7 To the skeptic who doubts perception: "You are not me"

		<title>Command as Proposition; World Contingency</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2008/02/16/command-as-proposition/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1</strong> Are imperatives, or commands, propositions that can hold truth-values?
<strong>1.1</strong> I cannot imagine that they are not propositions.
<strong>1.2</strong> They are projectional as to future states of affairs in so far as they anticipate those states of affairs with a conceivable and definite associative-value.
<strong>1.21</strong> Thus, truth or falsity is assigned to the nature of the proposition.
<strong>1.22</strong> Thus, an imperative implicates a factual claim about the future. It must be a proposition.
<strong>1.3</strong> "Buy A!" would advance the proposition: At event Z the product A will be present.
<strong>1.4</strong> If the imperative is not attended to, then this means the future state of affairs involving that proposition is false in so far as the imperative depicts it as <em>at least</em> provisionally being the case.
<strong>1.5</strong>The event ("conclusion") does not follow from the imperative "Buy A" ("premise"), should the imperative "Buy A" have an assignment of "false" to it.
<strong>1.6</strong> We could elaborate on "Buy A"; e.g. "[Y]ou must (p)urchase a book."
<strong>1.61</strong> "is going to purchase a book" would be the predicate of the person targetted by the command. So, it is a singular statement such that "Py" has a truth-value assignment of <strong>true</strong>.
<strong>1.62</strong> We find that the issue of future contingents arises: The proposition with a truth-value is contingent upon the future state of affairs.
<strong>1.7</strong> The speaker of the proposition has represented her understanding of the world&mdash;through the proposition&mdash;to the world as a contingent proposition; that is, the world in so far as its upcoming event, where thes proposition will find its assignment, is decidedly understood as itself contingent upon the assignment of the proposition.
<strong>1.8</strong> From the speaker, is the world contingent upon the proposition or the proposition contingent upon the world?
<strong>1.81</strong> Is there prevalence amongst inter-subjective propositions? Does the proposition ever "hit" the world, as inquiry <strong>1.8</strong> implies?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The (f)ool says in his heart, "There is no (G)od." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none that does (g)ood.
&mdash;Psalms 14.1; RSV</blockquote>
<strong>1</strong> <em>The (f)ool says in his heart, "There is no (G)od."</em>
<strong>1.1</strong> That is, "No (f)ool believes in God."
<strong>1.11</strong> &forall;x(Fx&sup;-Gx)
<strong>1.2</strong> Clearly, this is an empirical claim: (a) Historically, why did it arise? Who said "There is no God."? (b) Contemporarily, why does it persist? Do people say "There is no God." in the manner in which the theist interprets the saying? How does the conflation of God and "good" factor in?
<strong>1.3</strong> If a theist never personally met an atheist who claimed "There is no God", would he be self-constrained (This is laughable; I mean "religiously constrained"&mdash;whoops, free will!) to believe &exist;x(Fx&-Gx) dogmatically?
<strong>2</strong> <em>They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none that does (g)ood.</em>
<strong>2.1</strong> That is, "Fools are not good", or "No fools are good".
<strong>2.11</strong> &forall;x(Fx&sup;-Gx)
<strong>2.2</strong> How did this claim come about? What is the prerequisite or qualifier for a "good" action? Is it that which conforms to an established moral system? Is the presumption that the given moral system transcends all moral systems, and thus should any action run counter to it, that action is necessarily "bad"? Presumed transcendence must have an empirical consequence or some "leading to" which justifies the conclusions of "transcendence." Back to Euthyphro!
<strong>3</strong> Notwithstanding the external difficulty with such claims, we are left with no internally coherent argument. Yes, we have two statements, but, given that the Christian defines her God as "good," both statements say exactly the same thing internally, within the Christian sphere of morality.
<strong>3.1</strong> This brews a great potential for prejudicing, moral projection, should it be accepted that "reasoning" found in what has been cited is valid. It is not reasoning or rational; we are given two assertions which are the exact same proposition. No internal check as to validity can be made (We must not let the proper rules of reasoning get imprisoned within the domain of a moral system.); if we extract the terms to give them sense outside of the Christian nomenclature, we have meaningless babble.
<strong>3.2</strong> Why is that? Well, let us define "fool"&mdash;Is it mere name-calling? What is the denotation? Arbitrary social division (There's us! And then there's them!)? When can I be certain that I have met a "fool"? By their actions or by my presumption, my prejudice?; let us understand what it means to have a proposition "in one's heart" (&mdash;at birth or acquired?); "There is no God" has a term yet to be defined to the atheist's satisfaction; the social and linguistic implications of "corruption" and "abominable" require sure meaning within the climate of the author and within the climate of contemporary adherents of such a belief beyond mere presumption; and finally, what is "good"?
<strong>3.3</strong> I'm afraid reasoning such as this is all too ubiquitous. But my true question wonders at the infinite procedure which takes as backwards to the first moralizing event in the history of humanity. Who was the first moralizer? The first to see things as "x is Good; therefore, what you claim to be x is in fact not x. It is y. Anything not-x is Evil." I suppose it's an elementary question, but nonetheless, it is here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1</strong> Is social contract theory justification based on empiricism? Is what's "practical" just that which is "empirical"? Is pragmatism consistent&mdash;morally and scientifically&mdash;with empiricism?
<strong>1.1</strong> Can theory of governmental sovereignty based on power give a prescriptive philosophical argument more tenable than the social contract theory? Is it false that the theory of power is completely descriptive and lacking in instrumentality as to political purview.
<strong>1.2</strong> Can the theory of power give ethical argument more consistent, politically applicable, and sufficiently morally acceptable than (a) virtue ethics, (b) deontology, and (c) consequentialism?
<strong>1.3</strong> Does the theory of power reduce to consequentialism?
<strong>1.4</strong> Do the presuppositions of virtue ethics preclude it from being empirically verified?
<strong>1.41</strong> Does virtue ethics reduce to cultural relativism (a politically untenable, instrumentally lacking position to political and ethical argument)?
<strong>1.411</strong> That is, let us give closer inspection to that which we call "virtue". Can the claim "Understanding is the first and only basis of virtue" actually hold consistency with virtue ethics? Can the "process of understanding" itself be a virtue&mdash;by the standard definition of virtue within virtue ethics&mdash;without succumbing to the less than desirable aspects of the theory of power?
<strong>1.412</strong> "less than desirable aspects"; (Theory=) Is there a "Negligibility Doctrine" (Nietzschean) within the theory of power which can be construed as morally repugnant?
<strong>1.5</strong> Deontology: [need a better understanding]
<strong>1.51</strong> Forms of: Kant; others.
<strong>1.6</strong> Does does consequentialism result in "ghost hunts" for those which its proponents call "good outcomes"?
<strong>1.61</strong> If (Premise=) consequentialism is completely teleological, then consequentialism is necessarily false. Necessarily false propositions are false starts; they explain nothing except that which is presupposed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[2008 Presidential Candidate Mike Gravel is fighting for a <em>direct democracy</em> through what's called "the National Initiative." I'd love to hear the "idealistic" retort. What's the basic idea? "Ordinary American citizens can gain control of their government by becoming lawmakers, stemming government growth and turning it to public benefit."<sup>1</sup>

<strong>Links:</strong>
1. "The Concept of The National Initiative" [<a href="http://www.gravel2008.us/?q=node/114">link</a>]
2. The National Initative for Democracy [<a href="http://www.nationalinitiative.us/">link</a>] (Go <a href="https://votep2.us/">vote</a>.)

<strong>Democracy Amendment to the Constitution:</strong>
<blockquote>1) amends the Constitution asserting the legislative powers of the people, 
2) outlaws the use of monies not from natural persons in initiative elections, 
3) creates an Electoral Trust (vital to maintain citizen lawmaking independent of representative government) and defines the role of its trustees, and 
4) legitimizes the national election conducted by Philadelphia II, a non-profit IRS 501 C (4) corporation, giving Americans the opportunity to vote on the National Initiative.</blockquote>
<strong>Democracy Act:</strong>
<blockquote>...is a proposed federal law that 
1) sets out deliberative legislative procedures (copied from Congress and vital for intelligent lawmaking) to be used for initiative lawmaking by citizens,
2) defines the limited powers of the Electoral Trust that administers the legislative procedures on behalf of the people, and 
3) defines the electoral threshold that must be reached for the National Initiative to become the law of the land. 

It is important to understand that the National Initiative does not alter the existing structure or powers of representative governments. Rather, it adds an additional check –– the people –– to our system of Checks and Balances, while setting up a working partnership between the people and their elected representatives. Once the people become lawmakers, they will be able to reform many of the dysfunctional practices of representative government by initiative laws enacted by a majority of voting citizens.</blockquote>

<strong>Article V:</strong>
<blockquote>The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Obama for Corporations:</strong>
<blockquote>Obama has already cashed in on his "Race, but not really, Card" - to the tune of <em>$25 million dollars in contributions in the first three months of this year, three-quarters of it from corporations</em>. This does not happen by accident. Since setting foot in the U.S. Senate, Obama has directed his entire message machine to the task of convincing corporate America that he is a friend who can be counted on to leave the actual Power Game in their hands. One of his first votes was to transfer most class action suits to federal courts, where multi-billion-dollar companies found guilty of race, gender or general employee abuse are fined the equivalent of the millionaire CEO's latest weekend at the casinos in Monaco. In the process of taking class action suits out of state courts, where the penalties to offending corporations have historically been much harsher, Obama voted against an amendment to put a cap of 30 percent on credit card debt charges. A fraction of that multi-billion dollar gift to the most unproductive sector of the economy wound up in his campaign coffers.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just got <em>Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain</em>, and I'm skimming through it, rather than reading Aristotle's False Starts ("Nichomachean Ethics"). Anyway, some definitions:
<strong>1</strong> "feeling": Feeling is a neuropsychological response we give to certain emotional situations.
<strong>1.1</strong> Feeling is the most basic quality found therein emotional states.
<strong>1.2</strong> Feeling consists of our pleasures & our pains; our capacity to desire is the driving force.
<blockquote>The principal meaning of the word feeling refers to some variant of the experience of pain or pleasure as it occurs in emotions and related phenomena.
&mdash;pg. 3: Footnote; c. 1: Enter Feelings</blockquote>
<strong>2</strong> "emotion": Emotion is the language of feeling. (I do not consider this usage a poetic divergence. I use "language" as bounded to the definition of "language-game.")
<strong>2.1</strong> Naturally, you get those emotional states from interaction with people, things, the world.

Damasio provides a few startling conclusions from previous experiments:
<blockquote>First, individual feelings could be prevented through damage to a discrete part of the brain; the loss of a specific sector of brain circuitry brought with it the loss of a specific kind of mental event. Second, it seemed clear that different brain systems controlled different feelings; damage to one area of the brain anatomy did not cause all types of feelings to disappear at once. Third, and most surprising, when patients lost the ability to express a certain emotion, they also lost the ability to experience the corresponding feeling. But the opposite was not true: Some patiences who lost their ability to experience certain feelings still could express the corresponding emotions.
&mdash;pg. 5; c. 1: Enter Feelings</blockquote>

&mdash;<em>History of Sexuality</em>, p.97; Focault </blockquote>

<blockquote>The analysis [of power] should not attempt to consider power from its internal point of view and...should refrain from posing the labyrinthine and unanswerable question: 'Who then has power and what has he in mind? What is the aim of someone who possesses power?' Instead, it is a case of studying power at the point where its intention, if it has one, is completely invested in its real and effective practices.
&mdash;<em>History of Sexuality</em>, p.93; Focault</blockquote>

1 "intention": a determination to act in a certain way; or, a concept considered as the product of attention directed to an object of knowledge

2 "trajectory": a path, progression, or line of development resembling a physical trajectory; or, the path of a projectile or other moving body through space.

<blockquote>I shall consider human actions and desires in exactly the same manner, as though I were concerned with lines, planes, and solids.

It is not for nothing that I have been a philologist, perhaps I am a philologist still, that is to say, A TEACHER OF SLOW READING:- in the end I also write slowly. Nowadays it is not only my habit, it is also to my taste - a malicious taste, perhaps? - no longer to write anything which does not reduce to despair every sort of man who is 'in a hurry'. For philology is that venerable art which demands of its votaries one thing above all: to go aside, to take time, to become still, to become slow - it is a goldsmith's art and connoisseurship of the WORD which has nothing but delicate, cautious work to do and achieves nothing if it does not achieve it lento. But precisely for this reason it is more necessary than ever today, by precisely this means does it entice and enchant us the most, in the midst of an age of 'work', that is to say, of hurry, of indecent and perspiring haste, which wants to 'get everything done' at once, including every old or new book:- this art does not so easily get anything done, it teaches to read WELL, that is to say, to read slowly, deeply, looking cautiously before and aft, with reservations, with doors left open, with delicate eyes and fingers...My patient friends, this book desires for itself only perfect readers and philologists: LEARN to read me well!

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Voting for a third party candidate is largely a <em>symbolic</em> gesture, and one that will not be prominent in this more <em>pragmatic</em> election climate. [my emphasis]</blockquote>
A student at a Daily Cougar staff forum commented with what's quoted above to the question:
<blockquote>Ralph Nader, an independent candidate, is joining the presidential race - again. Do you think his rapid entry into the campaign will prevent the victory of presidential hopefuls Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., or Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y.?</blockquote>
Asking this question presupposes that Nader has ever "prevented the victory" for any "presidential hopeful." Nader and others argue that he did not, and it's foolish to even raise the question as if his presence did. It's disturbing that people still continue to make this sort of proposition: "If [Nader's presence in the previous race cost the Democrats the election], and if [Nader enters the upcoming presidential race], then [his entrance will cost the Democrats this upcoming election]." But that's exactly what's at issue: the first antecedent premise. Never mind the consequent! 

It's highly debatable that he did in fact cost the Democrats the previous election. The proposition is illegitimate, and therefore the question is illegitimate. But reason is not a friend of any media outlet. I suppose simply taking the first premise to be true is what the media is all about. We've got to ask <em>something</em>! Is this ethical? Is it <em>right</em> to cause the audience to lose sight of valid inquiry into important matters? Historical amnesia keeps the media in business and massive dissent at bay. The exploitation of human nature is sickening.

Anyway, what's the deal with this "pragmatic climate" claim? First, U.S. citizens are being "pragmatic" about their speculations of a future administration & its political implications? I don't give the populace that much credit.

Nader and other champions of Democracy, like Gravel, who founded the National Initiative, <em>are</em> advocating what is "pragmatic." They believe the American people should be more politically involved than they are, asserting their legislative presence. If "pragmatism" involves keeping soldiers in Iraq, then we've got issue with weighing human lives in money as opposed to, alternatively speaking, engaging in strict diplomacy (with money). Nader and Gravel are for diplomacy and emphasize exit strategies. To say the least, staying or exiting both hold speculative “pragmatic” outcomes. But I think I get it: “pragmatic” necessarily means “actions (military presence) speak louder than words”. Adages sicken me when they give bleak predictions.

So <em>that</em> is <em>necessarily</em> pragmatic, when folks introduce terms as if uncontested. I say "uncontested" because it appears in the news paper while the public's awareness, or lack of awareness, of the true term produces obliviousness as to what is actually being discussed (Are these candidates <em>really</em> the <em>only</em> “pragmatic” ones?). Terms become reconfigured within the sphere of the social norm; that is, the language-game of media communication. That said, an uncontested term flows "necessarily" on the wing of its new, modified definition but, perhaps, under the radar of socio-linguistic awareness & criticism. To put it tersely, not everybody’s Socrates! Let the term slide. We <em>know</em> & <em>trust</em> the media wouldn't err on the usage of a term because we “know” it too!

Pragmatism as Action (military presence for the U.S. in the Middle East)&mdash;what a despicable blend of biased ideals! Is the "pragmatic climate" (the majority) seeking to <em>verify</em> any of the goods, the beauty, of "progress" being made in the Middle East? And by whose standard do we determine what constitutes this progress?

Further, what’s pragmatic about these mainstream candidates' views on national health insurance? If we’re talking pragmatism, we’re talking empirical justification. Look at Canada & Britain, and then see if the claim that the Democrats’ campaigns are consistent with “pragmatism” is a valid one.

I highly doubt Obama's and Clinton's popularity has anything to do with pragmatism, unless we define what's pragmatic as a person's fancy, as a U.S. citizen's inclination to <em>bear arms</em>&mdash;with all the socio-psychological implications that entails about this country.

I've got imperialism in my acculturated veins.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Chapter II. Of The Mind; The Ethics</strong>
<blockquote>D2: I say that to the essence of any thing belonds that which, being <em>given</em>, the thing is [also] necessarily posited and which, being taken away, the thing is necessarily [also] taken away; or that without which the thing can neither be nor be conceived, and which can neither be nor be conceived without the thing. [my emphasis]

D3: By idea I understand a concept of the mind which the mind forms because it is a thinking thing.
Exp.: <em>I say concept rather than perception, because the word perception seems to indicate that the mind is acted on by the object. But concept seems to express an action of the mind.</em>

D7: By singular things I understand things that are finite and have a determinate existence. And if a number of individuals so concur in one action that together they are all the cause of one effect, I consider them all, to that extent, as one singular thing.</blockquote>
Spinoza's epistemology is eerie, naturalistic, and strictly logical. However, this axiom is difficult to digest without qualms.
<blockquote>A5: We neither <em>feel</em> nor <em>perceive</em> any singular things, except <em>bodies</em> and <em>modes of thinking</em>.</blockquote>
Now, "feeling" and "bodies" are quite easily to conceptually grasp. We experience sensations and the corresponding bodies which exist are necessarily posited given that we do in fact sense something, namely the bodies given. "Perceiving" cannot be said to be only a form of "feeling", as if just a synonym. Necessarily, for Spinoza, all our perceptions are of substance and its modes, but, under a more Spinozistic definition, what we "perceive" are the "modes of thought." Therefore, our perceptions are constituted with what we perceive of the modes of thinking.

In Spinoza's <em>Metaphysical Thoughts</em>, appended to his exposition of Cartesian philosophy, he distinguishes between "modes of reason (or thought)", "chimaeras", and "ficticious beings." The first, modes of thought, are concepts such as love, sorrow, doubt, and so on; chimaeras would be contradictions, such as the proposition "She loves me, and she does not love me" (not that she hates me, because "hate" is but a contrary to "love"&mdash;Spinoza admits we can have contraries existing in our minds with the same object as a target of these affects, hate and love); and ficticious beings, or fictions, are propositions we take to believe because those propositions appeal to our finite intellects which constantly battle with our passions.

Yet, given this axiom, by Spinoza's understanding, fictions and contradictions are never actually and truly perceived or felt. Perhaps, neither of these entities truly exist in Nature. Could we say, at least initially, that we posit the "contradiction"&mdash;or the law of noncontradiction&mdash;as a cognitive instrument or, even worse, a tendency of our minds? But what of the "fiction"? Can we deny that our states of belief contain meaning? I'm sure we could doubt the claim that belief-states do. Of course, this is all hinged on the assumption that Spinoza maintained his views consistently since the publication of his <em>Metaphysical Thoughts</em> up to the publication of his <em>Ethics</em>. We have no reason to believe he did not, and we should try our best to understand seemingly inconsistent notions from the text for our lack of understand may simply be an attempt of our mind to simply reject the consequences which perturb us. Namely, an argument may be raised which proposes "yes, of course we experience or perceive real, or classical, contradictions" or "people latch onto, after perceiving, fictions all the time!"

Indeed, it is difficult to take Spinoza at face value for a postulate he takes to be an axiom. It is strange that he would consider it as such without any hesitation (by "hesitation", I refer to something like his disclaimer at P8 of Chapter 1 regarding P7), but, of course, he labored rigorously over the Ethics. So, he must have had good reason to grace the chapter with such an axiom, rather than attempting to demonstrate it as a proposition. That said, I will adhere to the Principle of Sufficient Reason so that I may determine the true nature of this seemingly strangely axiom; it may be a trivial answer or a mere lapse in my recollection of Spinoza's text, but nevertheless, an answer shall be obtained!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ralph Nader</strong>
<blockquote>In 2000 Al Gore won the political lottery. As luck would have it, the Republicans that year nominated a hideous, half-witted little frat boy named George W. Bush. Casting a vote for Ralph Nader didn't seem like too much of a gamble in New York - a state that Gore was expected to (and did) win easily. Who would have thought that so huge a segment of the American electorate would actually be foolish enough to vote for a corrupt, mentally unbalanced little piece of shit from Crawford, Texas? Who would have even dreamed in a million years that the Bush Mob would have been able to steal the state of Florida by illegally removing 57,000 African Americans from the list of eligible voters? Who among us could have possibly imagined that so thoughtful and intelligent a man as Al Gore would run one of the dumbest campaigns in American political history?
&mdash;<a href="http://tomdegan.blogspot.com/2008/02/its-hard-to-get-angry-at-someone-like.html">Oh, Ralph, you've done it again!</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>But the evidence suggests another possible motive for Nader to run this year -- namely, that he hopes to help his longtime ally John McCain, to whom he owes at least one big favor. Nader is already focusing his fire on the Democrats, with his Web site featuring dozens of press releases attacking Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, while none voice the slightest criticism of McCain. In his latest round of television appearances, Nader trained his fire directly on Obama.
&mdash;<a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/conason/2008/02/29/mccain_nader/index.html">Ralph Nader loves John McCain</a></blockquote>

<strong>Barack Obama</strong>
<blockquote>Why should we believe Obama has courage to bring about change? He wouldn’t have his picture taken with San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom when visiting San Francisco for a fundraiser in his honor because Obama was scared voters might think he supports gay marriage (Newsom acknowledged this to Reuters on January 26, 2007 and former Mayor Willie Brown admitted to the San Francisco Chronicle on February 5, 2008 that Obama told him he wanted to avoid Newsom for that reason.)
&mdash;<a href="http://beyondchron.org/news/index.php?itemid=5413">The Obama Craze: Count Me Out </a></blockquote>

<strong>John McCain</strong>
<blockquote>In a letter to the Federal Election Commission, the Democratic National Committee said McCain has probably surpassed the roughly $50 million limit he agreed to observe when he applied for public funding last year. McCain, the front-runner for the Republican nomination to contest November's presidential election should not be allowed to withdraw from the public-funding system now that he no longer needs it, the DNC argued. "He intends to simply ignore and flout the law," it said. "Senator McCain is not free to do that without the Commission's approval."
&mdash;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/25/AR2008022502456.html">Democrats criticize McCain over campaign finance</a></blockquote>

<strong>Hilary Clinton</strong>
<blockquote>Do Hillary Clinton and John Edwards think they're better than the rest of the Democratic candidates for president? Apparently, just after a forum in Detroit yesterday, Fox News microphones picked up the two whispering about how to exclude the less popular candidates from upcoming debates. "We should try to have a more serious and a smaller group," the mic reportedly caught Edwards saying. Clinton reportedly agreed, replying, "We've got to cut the number...they're not serious."
&mdash;<a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2007/07/13/whispers/index.html">Caught on tape</a></blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>John McCain</strong>
<blockquote>So the Senator did what I call, The McCain Hunch. Again and again he grabbed his ankles and apologized to the K Street lobbyists, reversing his positions on, well, you name it. For example, in 2001, he said of Bush’s tax cuts, “I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle-class Americans.” Now, in bad conscience, the Senator vows to make these tax cuts permanent.
&mdash;<a href="http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/31382">Exxon suxx. McCain duxx</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>

George Bush already said that McCain is a good conservative, which for many people is the kiss of death, but for many neocons it's a very worthy endorsement. So if we're going to have McCain, it's good for the Pentagon, it's good for the military-industrial establishment. But Americans in the world must be warned: it's going to be less jobs, more war.
&mdash;<a href="http://therealnews.com/web/index.php?thisdataswitch=0&thisid=969&thisview=item">McCain "will make Cheney look like Gandhi"</a></blockquote>

<strong>All of 'em</strong>
<blockquote>Assumption two: voters ought to vote strategically, i.e., for the lesser of two evils. Even for those who accept this curiously alienating concept, however, evil often comes in pairs. Most citizens think the U.S. has lost more than it has gained under NAFTA; neither Obama nor McCain want to repeal it. Most people want the U.S. out of Iraq; both men have repeatedly voted to prolong the war. How shall anti-NAFTA, antiwar voters divine which will prove least anathematic as president? Should they resort to a ouija board?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1</strong> The Absurdity Threshold:&mdash;As children, we begin as outliers to it. Our only resistance is our innocence; &amp; we swing with our feeble shields at its <em>horror</em> merely because we are here, with those <em>others</em>.
<strong>2</strong> &amp; we become writers, bucklers to pens.
<strong>3</strong> But our foolish literature today lies wanting portent, &amp; it is important for the children after us, new ones following the dictate of it. &amp; if you start now, you can give those new ones enough inspiration, entertainment (contradiction), &amp; love to thrive. You attempted to crush it under the weight of your pen, your words, your face!
<strong>4</strong> Only by facing it&mdash;not just <em>reaching</em> for it but under the guise of your own <em>belief</em> that you are one step away from stumbling over it&mdash;can you see there is no beyond it.
<strong>5</strong> Perhaps if you bring the new ones to it as early as possible a cogent <em>feeling</em> will compel their memory, their consciousness, to having had stepped beyond it: to step beyond our own humanity&mdash;that human sickness&mdash;is why we write. We want our <em>madness</em> known.
<strong>6</strong> Never write for the present, <em>now</em> only for the new ones preconfigured to decode our literature. Sufficient evidence <em>must</em> adequately translate our language, we writers say, into the struggle we shared against it; it reads <em>us</em> with fear because we writers today <em>failed</em> so miserably at the grammar lines. <em>Nous sommes tombé</em>&mdash;through the cracks of our <em>competence</em>!
<strong>7</strong> Imagine it, cowering at the sight of itself as if thriving. (See how our quibbled quills are so worn &amp; damaged.)
<strong>8</strong> Nevertheless, only through language can our desperate &amp; primitive picture appear&mdash;never say: "as the threnody for our pens."
<strong>9</strong> Should you not&mdash;as you <em>cannot</em>&mdash;, at that beginning will we <em>be</em> <em>human</em> to their faces. I promise you: they will hurl themselves back to us, through our firm <em>displacement</em> of them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The third very fertile source of doubt is the fact that Hebrew verbs in the indicative mood lack the present, the past imperfect, the pluperfect, the future perfect, and other tenses most frequently employed in other languages; in the imperative and infinitive moods they are wanting in all except the present, and a subjunctive mood does not exist. Now, although all these defects in moods and tenses may be supplied by certain fundamental rules of language with ease and even elegance, the ancient writers evidently neglected such rules altogether, and employed indifferently future for present and past, and <em>vice versâ</em> past for future, and also indicative for imperative and subjunctive, with the result of considerable confusion.

		<title>Supernatural Beings Are Never Posited</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Demonstration</em>: 
(1) If a supernatural <em>nature</em> can <em>only</em> be expressed or understood through <em>natural</em> objects, then the supernatural nature has <em>no positive</em> attributes which can be expressed or understood by the natural cognitive processes of the human mind.
(2) Any nature that has no positive attributes which can be expressed is not posited.
(3) God, a supernatural being presumably having a supernatural nature, has a nature which cannot be expressed positively.
(4) Therefore, God does not "exist" (is not posited) as a nature that is supernatural, but only exists as a nature which is natural.

<em>Scholium 1</em>: We could say: "God is a cognitive heuristic device for 'hope'" or "God is a mode of thinking that elicits certain desirable effects"; however, the latter would reduce the concept of God to a form of utilitarianism under the master-slave moral system; e.g. Divine Command Theory, etc. Nevertheless, these utilities of the concept reduce to contingent definitions which are everywhere in flux. God cannot be immutable because the human mind, as far as conceiving God, produces unique but myopic pictures of the concept in question. ("My emperor can defeat your emperor in <em>this </em>way.")

<em>Scholium 2</em>: Imagine a deafblind person born as such. This person cannot understand that God, presumably, has a personality or made sacrifices unless it is conveyed through natural means. That is, braille words correspond to natural objects (people, concepts which arise in people such as love, etc). The deafblind person would learn that God is, say, a <em>non-physical</em> person whereas her imagination would have to fabricate its qualities of being. But no positive attribute would be posited except those asserted in physical persons such as her family or instructors. She would say, "Is this fork like God?" Her instructors reply: "No, a fork is nothing like God" etc. So every claimed positive attribute, for God, would have to be negated in order to convey the God-concept's meaning. It would have to be presupposed that God something like a natural thing but the negation of such. In times of conflicting natures, it would have to be persuaded that God is one concept of a conflicting nature over another; nevertheless, natural objects and concepts would be used through their negations to show, however successfully, which "attributes" apply to God. This would be negative theology, or simply arbitrary acculturation. No positive assertion as to God's nature would arise, only negative assertions. But, as Wittgenstein tells us, "explanation must end somewhere." If we infinitely spiral through negations, nothing will be positively asserted and nothing will be understood except that which tires the mind, causing it to demand "no more!", because of the regress. However, being tired of attempting to understand is no proof of anything. QED.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Certainly some candidates deserve more coverage than other candidates. But one is tempted to wonder whether the same cycle exists here as well. Polls are conducted more than a year in advance of the first caucuses and primaries, when certain candidates lead the polls based on nothing more than name recognition. The media then bases most of its coverage around those select few, which creates the perception among the public that they are indeed the frontrunners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our expressions are latent with mistakes&mdash;
Chisel that anecdote to the lobes of my ears,
And I will perform questionable experiments,
Legitimating its grammar along errant pathways

Calculate the dexterity of my Reason: conclusions,
I denote immanence with traps of certainty,
Where with rhythmic tendency congenital earthworms
Tremble in the presence of our faulty narrative

We cabal of ears echo the misprints of our brothers,
And our sisters rage with tits and minds bewildering
Those writers and poets we ignore; their plight
We implore; with threnodies we smash dated prophecies

Historiography trains us in absurdity; never accept
Hypocrites and bakers waiting, as a rise of theme
Breaks the taboo&mdash;ensembles collide; to wit,
Truths we speak drown in puddles of clever spit

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I noticed REDvolution party members at a CLASS Senate candidate debate I attended frequently shouting to vote a "straight ticket" or to “vote REDvolution!” It’s curious that this mentality is coupled with SGA’s recent decision to remove party labels from the ballots.

SGA members and those apologetic to the SGA's legislation and will have howled at the foul reporting produced by the Daily Cougar. That "strictly" speaking "parties won't appear on the ballot" is their defense. It's not a “rule,” they argue further, that CLASS Senate hopefuls and SGA constituents cannot assemble and band together (otherwise, unconstitutionality could be charged); it is only that the ballot has undergone some structural readjustment, a layout change. It seems something like that the SGA came to a conclusion: a legislative decision for a typeface change was necessary. The ballot got a fancy new dress.

It's been argued that the point of the ballot redesign obtained an immediate and agreeable effect. Now those manic devils wishing to fight for halting the increase in student frees, albeit its imminence, or to put recycle bins where they're obviously due must rumble and sweat along the campaign trail for their seats. That's likely; or is it?

During the Question-Answer round, questions such as "Why haven't you guys been [grassroots] campaigning?" and "How do you expect us to trust that you'll have time to 'fight' for us if you don't campaign?" were raised. Oh, they campaigned: through Facebook, with posters, that sort. A majority of the CLASS Senate candidates, except for a few (I recall one being REDvolution.), threw themselves at the mercy of the audience. Obstacles such as "work" and "school" seemed to furnish a sweeping credence to a false dilemma. Our devils are looking less frightening, less politically astute.

Most interesting was the mention of M.D. Anderson Library and its possible Starbucks project. “How would you respond if a Starbucks were to appear in the library before the library were to become a 24/7 gig for, as has been presumptuously put, late-night toiling away at the books?” So how would you? 

Asked before that were a few lightning rounders: Do you support 100% Fair Trade coffee on campus? Do you think the library should never close? Many said “no,” and all said “yes.” So I said interesting: the relationship between the Fair Trade movement on campus and that sweet library spot is an intimate yet seemingly forgotten one.


I doubt any candidate at that debate has read bill UB44002, passed by the Senate of the 44th SGA on April 4th, 2007, that reads “The location of the 100% Fair Trade Certified coffee kiosk will be in the 24 hour lounge in the M.D. Anderson Library, and should be established within a reasonable time frame.”

Quickly now: Do those who answered “no” not support SGA’s informed legislative decision-making? Do they, without pause, reject giving Starbucks competitors a chance, even a small kiosk of a chance? What is the point of even asking such a bloated and feeble question? If you mind the bill, the question of “Is a 100% Fair Trade campus pretty cool?” is worthless and ineffectual. The bill has already been passed. Read it, and get on it, candidates.

The redress of the ballot presumably forced Senate candidates to campaign, averting their chances of riding on party success and affiliation, but, as was admitted, campaigning is discourse for the backburner. “You just can’t expect us to fit that in too!” Perhaps the SGA shot its own foot with its legislative decision—or at least potential SGA members’ feet.

But shouldn’t the removal of party labels from the ballot carry a more idealistic and commendable tune? I doubt “Vote straight REDvolution,” say, properly soothes anyone’s ears. Regardless of what the “rules” say, students are criticizing political character, and the SGA should expect that “removing the label” or similar desktop publishing gimmickry does not solve the actual problem of party politicking.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Leibniz was a Douchebag</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Assertion:</strong> This is the best of all possible worlds.

<strong>Proof:</strong> God chose from infinite set of possible worlds. God, a being that is all-good, must be both the [creator] of the world and the [judge] of its goodness. Naturally, God has the capacity for both; therefore, God chose from the infinite set the best possible world.

<strong>Counter:</strong> How does one choose a particular out of an infinite set without doing so arbitrarily (amorally; and by indirect inference, immorally because moral facts have no justification and are not accounted for--nihilism)? Wouldn't choosing the "best possible" presuppose that the world chosen was in fact the set which contained all the possibilities? Is a world not, in effect, a domain of possibilities (and potentialities)? Are we linguistically fucking the word "possibility" here? Or "world"? Tell me you see an equivocation! A "world" is <em>both</em> a particular within a infinite set of possibilities and a set of infinite possibilities? So, that is, Leibniz or Spinoza, respectively. Can a particular of the former set have infinite possibility without turning it into the set where it presumably inheres? Let us take it as an <em>article of faith.</em>

What do we call the set which contained all the worlds? "The Best Possible Set"? How do we know God chose from the Best Possible Set? Well, the set was infinite. But choosing a world as "best possible" within that set lifts it beyond the confines of that set. ("Which number is the best?"&mdash;think fast! God was doing this all "objectively.") What is the ambiguity behind superlative usage? Do superlatives presuppose moral outlooks? Is the world God's subjective presentation to us? Do we have an arbitrary number as world or a fanciful (infinite) PowerPoint as world? In either case, the answer is epistemically hopeless; we ask a meaningless question, we like to believe (we're in the best possible world, after all) that we'll be given a meaningful answer. (The world has meaning! I <em>get </em>answers, no matter how dirty and unjustified they are!)

Leibniz's argues: I as the mediator between you and God report God's moral outlook, and he is the infinite intellect. It's self-evident that he must choose the best from the infinite set. Scratch/failure. So "possible worlds" can be extracted from Leibniz's nonsense (however agonizing and meaningless they are), and the theory of possible worlds <em>must </em>be used objectively (no moral implication).

<strong>Lesson:</strong> Do not mix morality (empirical study of "goods"; this is how most see it: between burning building baby and drowning baby, who do you save?) and the calculus (mathematical entities).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I do not think Gettier's two-page refutation to Justified True Belief is plausible.<sup><a href="#gettier1">1</a></sup> In fact, I question even the relevance and authenticity of his counterexamples.

<strong>Counter Case I</strong>

The first counterexample goes like this. As far as Smith <em>knows</em> (saw into Jones' pocket &amp; the president said, "Jones will get the job", etc): 

<blockquote>(1) Jones (a man) has 10 coins in his pocket & Jones' (same man) likelihood of getting the job is imminent. </blockquote>

Gettier believes propositional knowledge-claim (1) entails the following propositional knowledge-claim:

<blockquote>(2) The man who has 10 coins in his pocket will get the job. </blockquote>

Now, I am rubbed the wrong way about this. First, the second-order properties<sup><a href="#second2">2</a></sup> of Jones, as Smith perceives them (has 10 coins in his pocket, the one who will get the job), in (1) become displaced and assumed to apply to all men in an equivocal way. Why do I say this? Obviously, the noun phrase "The man" in (2) is an existential particular by grammatical use. This means the use of the noun phrase "The man," seemingly deceptively, refers to either Jones specifically (still), or it does not. It is presumed, as far as Gettier's problem goes, to function as a knowledge-claim universal (okay, so it's locally universal; nevertheless, it seemingly does <em>not</em>). That is, upon conclusion, when Smith turns out the be <em>right</em> (thus <em>not</em> displaying <em>clear</em> knowledge about the state of affairs), the inference (2) cleverly presumes that the existential particular is now a (local) universal (for Smith to be right about). That is, Smith was right about (2), as it is argued, but wrong about (1). However, I do not feel that proposition (2) ever loses its meaning as proposition (1). Smith was always wrong, about both (1) and the rephrased proposition (2). I feel they are logical equivalents because the domain of discourse never changes in so far as Smith's available knowledge (what he's able to make a propositional knowledge-claim about).

As said and for emphasis, my argument is that (2) does not lose the particular domain of "Jones" as far as Smith's available knowledge is concerned (Jones is still and only "The man"). The inference (2) still contains "(Jones,) the man who..." etc. However, Gettier just drops the noun clause ("Jones,") for convenience. But doing so loses important and pertinent information as to Smith's knowledge-claim. What I reject is the plausibility of the inference as if the inference could refer to <em>any</em> man outside of the domain of Jones.

In what way does "Jones" translate to "The man" without sacrificing the meaning behind the propositional claim on Smiths part? Would Smith actually make that inference in his mind? Do we actually make these types of inferences? As far as Smith's knowledge is concerned, he could <em>only</em> make a knowledge-claim and accept, or believe, the truth of (1). (1) may be rephrased, but the proposition <em>cannot</em> lose its domain or its meaning. All the properties  and subjects contained in propositions must track, or travel, together; the rephrasing of original propositions carries with them the domain that gave them initial life.

Part of my argument, I feel, does stem from an argument of ignorance. I fail to imagine how such an inference would be made without simply being awkward and idealistic, "for the sake of argument" philosophy stuff. How would it come about that he decides to make the peculiar propositional knowledge claim "The man...etc"? Why would he say it? What I am asking is this: Is Gettier being a alienating scientist (just for the sake of argument) or a human being? Are we talking philosophy magic or observable human affairs? Is Gettier's (2) a Practical Platonic Form? Does it actually reflect the sort of cognitive discourse we take in our daily lives?

What if Jones happened to be a woman while, unknown to Smith along with many other men, Jones fooled Smith into believing she was of male gender? Thus, we would have to go further to say that Smith infers the following proposition.

<blockquote>(3) The human who has 10 coins in his or her pocket will get the job.</blockquote>

Now (3) is true, but Smith turns out to be false about (1). I feel this shows that proposition (2)'s properties and subject must track, as far as Smith's available knowledge, for it to be a useful proposition. Clearly, we could suppose Jones is an alien species, masquerading as a human being, and therefore, Smith would have to infer something along the lines of the following, clearly unhelpful, proposition.

<blockquote>(4) The living being who has 10 coins in its pocket will get the job.</blockquote>

When Smith turns out to be wrong, he turned out to be wrong about just (1), and (2) is utterly irrelevant (or just a rephrasing of (1), possibly with an attempt to deceive, that has the same meaning). For all we can suppose, Smith must infer (4) in order for it to be true. The inferences (2)-(4) are just a waste of text in the already brief essay by Gettier. (2) is the same as (1), though Gettier likes to believe it isn't, and therefore it is not applicable to justifying Gettier's counterargument against Smith's knowledge. (1) turned out to be false, along with (2)-(4); Smith believed it to be true, and it was justified given what Smith learnt about Jones. The point here is that Smith never satisfied justified true belief because proposition (1) was false, not that he wasn't justified in believing (1). He was always justified: (1) was, throughout the scenario (1), and never (2).

<strong>Counter Case II</strong>

This leads me to my second counter argument: the status of OR knowledge and Gettier's second "counterexample." 

If someone claims to know that "It is raining outside or it is snowing outside," would you call this a sufficient knowledge-claim? Of course not! It is a logical truth, and it says nothing about the world. It is justified by virtue of the rules of logic, but the rules of logic justify no <em>positive</em> claims about the world. The law of noncontradiction does not tell us what the thing is, only that you won't find it in the same spatio-temporal location/logical space as a thing of a contradictory nature; the law of identity only asserts that a thing is itself without premises (But we're arguing!); excluded middle is a fork (as we've just witnessed; by inference: "It is raining or it is not raining" leaves us inquiring further: So is it raining? "Well, it's either raining or it's snowing"--hopeless!) Humean skeptics show us that rational entailment is just a sham when concerning matters of fact, etc. So, the second claimed counterexample is described as follows.

<blockquote>(1) Jones owns a Ford. </blockquote>

(1) is true, Smith accepts/believes/knows (1), and is justified, in whatever way you want to build the story, in believing (1). Smith, by disjunctive inclusion, builds the following list. 

<blockquote>(2) Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in city A. 
(3) Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in city B. 
(4) Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in city C. </blockquote>

Gettier seems to believe Smith is justified in believing this. However, he gives little to no argument except the implicit one that logic somehow makes positive claims about knowledge. ("I know A is A by the law of identity."--no you don't, it's a rule, not a fact!", etc) 

(1) turns out to be false, but (3) turns out to be true because Brown happens to be, for whatever reason, in city B. Of course, Smith does not actually know this. It just happens to be the case; thus, (3) is true in a rather random way. 

However, in the first place, is the disjunction a knowledge claim about the state of affairs? Keep in mind that we're talking strictly about (3) as a propositional knowledge-claim. (Students in my class couldn't wrap their minds around how 3 turned out to be true.) 

So the point is, even if (3) is true, propositions of the form A v B are <em>not</em> knowledge claims. For entertainment, let's look at inclusive and exclusive. 

<blockquote>(5) Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in city B, or both.</blockquote>

This would result in a tautology, and therefore, it would not be a knowledge-claim about the world.

<blockquote>(6) Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in city B, but not both.</blockquote>

This is obviously the proposition Gettier is using. What about the intuitiveness of us using inclusive OR propositions? Open inspection of Smith's claims,--wait, there is no inspection! Gettier just assumes (6) is the intuitive claim. What reason does Gettier gives us to accept, without a fight, that (6) is the correct inference? My point is this: I do not think Gettier added enough rigor to his paper, and thus, without this added inspection, his arguments become ineffectual. 

In any event, let's take a look at (6). It is true because [B] is true while [F] is false, in the end, and it is not the case that they are both true. Therefore, the proposition is true. Aside from being an awkward proposition to infer in the first place, I must reiterate my probably already tiresome argument. (6) is not a knowledge-claim; it's not a proposition Smith could possibly be wrong about. The proposition does have statements about the world contained within it, but the proposition itself says nothing about the world. It is similar to a mathematical truth, such as "1 +  2 = 3". It can only be false iff the logical entities used somehow turn out to be false. Yes, the proposition is true, Smith accepts it, and he is justified in believing it; however, he is justified not due to any "matter of fact" about the world. What compels him to accept proposition is the fact that that he is cognitively unable to reject it. Do we actually reason this way?

<strong>Counter Case III (The Gettier Cases' Cousin)</strong>

Another Gettier counterexample deals with Fred, Sam, and a room (kinky). 

<blockquote>(1) Sam is in the room.</blockquote>

(1) is true (Sam has a twin brother who is visible in the room, but Sam is hiding somewhere in it), Fred accepts/believes (1), and Fred is justified (Fred sees Tim, Sam's twin, believing he is in fact Sam). 

Supposing that Fred has a sufficiently impaired faculty for recognizing the difference between the twins from afar is the only way in which this counterexample <em>might</em> work. However, how is Fred justified in his belief that Sam is in the room? Well, he sees Tim. 

We have found an issue of circular justification. Fred's belief that Sam is in the room presupposes the evidence he receives and whatever evidence he receives justifies his belief that Sam is in the room, regardless of the matter of fact that he sees Tim. This is called dogmatism. Fred does not see Sam; he seems Tim. His justification is absent; that is, is justification for believing that Sam is in the room is that he believes Sam is in the room.

This counterexample seems irrelevant because Sam's justification never enters the scenario. It's similar to that old saying about dogmatists: "He sees what he wants to see." This is equivalent to saying "I'm justified in my beliefs because I believe them." Fred was justified in believing that Sam was in the room because he believed that he saw Sam in the room. Whether or not the belief is true is irrelevant; we would not treat such a justification as worthy of investigation. Debating it philosophically is without merit whereas handling it psychologically might give us insight into how the human mind works.

<strong>Caution!</strong>

I think my take on <strong>Cousin Case III</strong> just proves Gettier's point.

		<title>Meta-ethical Relativism and Power</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1</strong> Moral facts reduce to socially, psychologically, or culturally crafted feeling-states which express certain physiological predispositions. ("Abortion is wrong" translates to "When I hear a nearby opinion on the issue I get a queer feeling of <em>this</em> sort.")

<strong>1.1</strong> Physiological predispositions express (speech, letters; in public, directly or indirectly) themselves as "emotional states" which are public only if perceived by another individual who too bears physiological predispositions; this can cause a ripple effect in the social and political waters. (Indirectly: "Susan told me her views on abortion, and I'm inclined to agree. She might not do anything about it, but her 'private views' have compelled me to public action", etc.) If an emotional state is not public, then describing it as "emotional" would lead to a performative contradiction. Emotion presupposes a social context (a public discourse); without a public environment, emotions are communicatively inert. Emotions presuppose some kind of effect (transmission of an idea); otherwise, they are only physical states without meta-data (ideas). (I cannot be or become angry without focusing on an object that acts as a referent for my emotional state; the object and my state go hand-in-hand, otherwise, I cannot be said to be "cognitively active." Further, "emotion" needs a third party; for something to be called "emotional" or a "display of emotion," an emoter, an object of emotion, and a perceiver (someone to receive the relation between, or idea that describes, emoter and object) are all three necessary.)

<strong>1.2</strong> Physiological predispositions of individuals originate from prior causes and the building of societal edifices which presuppose the within themselves the tools for future modification and change. ("Headline: Candidate propose change to the political climate", etc; but the candidates are largely influenced by the environment they wish to change, even if just to learn, as if very distanced and tactical, how to change it; nevertheless, it will touch them in a significant way.)

<strong>1.21</strong> These presuppositions of change which inhere; that is, the negation of themselves (society qua society), define the limits and identity of every societal context&mdash;the society itself. It cannot stand as society if not changing. (Heraclitus asserted, "All is flux, nothing is stationary"; here is the principle that we share with Nature.)

<strong>2</strong> Moral facts impose themselves like possible worlds onto our factual world. ("I have read the book of salvation, and I purport the world it describes...thou shalt not!") Possible worlds demand urgency of argument, though undeserving, and even the principle of possible-worlds theory untenable; this is the only world, and its possibilities are infinite. "Everything that can happen (is possible; not an outright contradiction or is fictitious) has occurred, is occurring or will occur"&mdash;this is the principle of the world's necessity. Possible worlds reduce to this world with its "modifications" by virtue of our finite intellects that posit their plausibility but lack the capability to describe them to any meaningful extent.

<strong>2.1</strong> Every individual moral fact ("Murder is wrong", etc) asserts more than its evidence allows, if even it has evidence. Moral facts, which depend on no evidence, are like souls: You are kind to your neighbor (You obey the fact's implicit imperative) because you fear the negative consequences its power (speaker) implies.

<strong>2.2</strong> Moral facts do exist, but they do not exist in the sense that they ought to be argued. They do not carry truth-value assignments. But you will argue with them; however, your argument is necessarily for persuasion (power). Read books, study the debate, etc only to enhance your sense of power.

<strong>3</strong> "power" is the influence entities maintain that displaces. Every thing displaces. What is the nature of this ontological fact?

<blockquote>i. Physically, what do you displace? 
ii. Morally, whom do you displace? (And do not let arbitrary geographic or bureaucratic "boundaries" preclude <em>probable</em> answers!) 
iii. Metaphysically, why do you displace? 
iv. Logically, when and where do you displace?
v. Scientism: What does it morally reduce to? What does it ignore in principle?</blockquote>

<strong>3.1 </strong>Ask yourself absurd questions like these. You are guaranteed contingent answers; that is, answers which promote <em>real</em> further movement. This is "philosophy."

<strong>3.2</strong> Moral facts are subject to the weight of power; power of entities (people, communities, etc) will dictate the travel and impositions of certain descriptive, or more precisely "culturally representative," moral facts, which are only the expression of those entities' strength. Moral facts of this sort carry (or presuppose) those identities they just so happen to consign to whatever unresearched political or social environment. This is the problem of "capitalism."

<strong>3.3</strong> Your "moral facts" do not fit our paradigm, our machine, in the way we unwittingly, though specifically, defined it; nevertheless, we reposition you in <em>this</em> way. Capitalism is the deus ex machina of the world. Pun aside; I would <em>drop the Book</em> too.

<strong>4 </strong>We argue for what is most pleasurable (rational). Rationality has become a pleasure. It is an object which contrasts "emotion." ("That sculpture shows a keen sense of rationality. Did the sculptor go to such-and-such university?")

<strong>4.1</strong> This word ("rationality", "rational", etc) does not break free from the confines of the language-game in which it originated. It has been and always will be used as a way to describe what is "ordered," what is easily apprehended by our memory, our mind. "Rational," like "emotional," must be viewed as stripped of all superlative descriptions. Like emotiveness, we in principle cannot confide in our rationality. What is the "rational" equivalent of murdering your children? Is everything I write here symbolic of a "rational outburst?" We look at emotionality through the scope of psychology. Do the same for "rationality"! Perhaps I&mdash;we&mdash;have lingered too long on postmodernity?

<strong>4.2</strong> Rationality is therefore a "moral fact" that is too subject to power; it is a feeling-state. "I feel rational", "The government has legislated rationally", etc.

<strong>5</strong> Weapons and might are superficial, and thus fictitious, objects which express "power." Arsenal, infantry, numbers, etc are all arbitrary facts of matter and position; they do not travel without meta-data (missions, purposes, names, geographic locations, diplomacy).

<strong>6</strong> What is the relationship between relativism, knowledge, and power?

<strong>6.1</strong> <em>Relativism</em>: The moral facts are everywhere seeking a Final Author or a Document of Standard written on the walls of Nature. Call this a "continuous state of affairs."

<strong>6.2</strong> <em>Knowledge</em>: Increases the gravity of the state of affairs with more evidence, more conflicting cultural viewpoints. "Relativism is true because my friends all disagree in detailed ways which I ought to respect and understand if I want to keep them happy."

<strong>6.3</strong> <em>Power</em>: My knowledge enhances my tools for persuasion of those external to me (external to societies, governments, etc).

<strong>6.4</strong> <em>Persuasion</em>: Let's call it "twisted euphemism for slaughter of 'false ideals,' with weapons or with words" (the effect of the massacre is what we analyze, what moves us); <em>all life is a moral war</em> that is translated into different aspects of the same struggle. Science is a moral war; Academia, the same, the media, the familial battleground, etc. I steal an idea: These are all inter-related/-locked language-games. We must distinguish the "enemy" within each and simply <em>move</em> that enemy aside. ("Let's not impeach and hang Bush, but hope that the layout of Presidential term limits displaces his overarching authority, re-establishing our own.") 

<strong>6.5</strong> There are no checkmates, only<em> repositionings</em>; life is movement, displacement; if you move, say, pull, etc, you are moving<em> against,</em> uttering <em>to</em>, pulling <em>from</em>.

<strong>7</strong> This is morality: The mere repositioning of figures on a game board.

<strong>7.1</strong> What is the rule for this game?&mdash;that one has the power to move others in various ways  (persuasion as science, persuasion as religion, etc).

<strong>7.2</strong> Jaded liberals will say, "Religion is more moral than Secularism. Look at what religion <em>now </em>accomplishes!" This presupposes that religion had the means to re-invent itself so that it could adapt. This is an incorrect view. Ideas do not re-invent themselves; ideas do not evolve. Humans evolve and through language and failed memory give names, which are pinned to ideas new life. ("Let's call it 'libertarian socialism' instead of 'anarchy'; or, "Let's re-label our ideologies as such: [adjectival] + [adjectival]"; but what are we describing?) Back to my point: Religion is not the impetus for human salvation; religion does not "call to arms" for social justice. Human beings do so, and call it "religion" or "religious" because they were under the linguistic umbrella to begin with. We're damned for new terms, and we're stuck in the old. This is "synthesis."

<strong>7.3</strong> Jesus said, "...let the dead bury their dead". Most interpret this as him saying that we ought to leave worldly matters behind as if dead, spiritually vacuous. Go a step further (keep him consistent)! Leave those people spiritually vacuous behind, the kingdom of heaven is not theirs, etc. This shows that Jesus was incongruent to human nature (proving his divinity and perfection). How? We assume no one is morally bankrupt. We travel great distances to "save" those "as Christians" or "as Muslims," etc. Jesus had no home team to represent. He was the home team; his psychology was radically contrary to our own.

<strong>8</strong> Again, we make presuppositions which stem from the our inclinations to modify things ("this is how it ought to be"): our limited societies implant in us those peculiarities (because society itself lacks) which make it seem fragmented and unstable. In fact, this gives it an identity that necessarily contains moral strife. The nature of every entities' internal war <em>necessarily</em> involves <em>at least</em> a relationship with externalities, i.e. "science is part of the moral war", "ethics [of] ...", etc.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Some Words on Infinite, Ethics, and Mathematics</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["… there must be simple substances, because there are compounds: for the compound is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simples."

Essentially, Leibniz says this, "Compounds presuppose simples" & "simples entail compounds".

How is this claimed to be true? Descartes & Spinoza admits that individuation is perceived through the mind (See: Descartes & the wax); "parts" as such are presuppositions of the mind which form "from the fact that they suppose an infinite quantity to be measurable and composed of finite parts" (Ethics II).

Infinite number, for instance, is not "measurable" in such the way that a finite number might be. Infinite number, by definition, contains all numbers. We do not "measure" or "count to" infinite. It is ontically a misapplication of attributes. It isn't that you "cannot" do it; you simply don't. The idea that infinite number is composed of numbers is due to our mind's inability to "perceive the infinite"; so, we impose finite objects onto the infinite in proportion to the limits of our minds. This restriction on Mind leads to the [objective] causation of all effects, which are of the infinite set. The limits of our understanding ("modes of thinking", "perception", etc) cause us to assume ethical dilemmas and assume they are solved. The concept that nature is "limited" is a prejudice of the mind; it is easy to consider individuated objects as such if we assume they have an identity uniquely dependent only upon their own internal qualities. Thus, rocks are hard simply because they have "hardness"; but where does "hardness" originate? Not in rocks! But neither in the "infinite" or God or what have you. Maybe I drift to a nominalist perspective now...

In any event, I reject the infinite, even in practice. It is without meaning and without (ethical) use; no, technological advancement is not a "use," but a pleasure, an inclination, as if populations' wants dictate what is moral. Because we give the infinite a name and foolishly use it "meaningfully" is the source of all inhumanity in ethics, as well as every other discourse. Speaking of it even in applied calculuses is improper, but we've got to move something! Shite on this rambling.

<strong>Mathematics as if it corresponded to the Infinite</strong>

Mathematics was not "invented" in the sense that someone takes two objects together and derives a new use from those objects as a singular object. Mathematics is a way (a science, set of operations, a calculus) in which our minds handle Number. Mathematics is to Number as Grammar is to Language. Arithmetic (as Mathematics) can be done poorly just as someone can have poor grammar. However, arithmetic, arguably, is less susceptible to flux in so far as its conclusions. (Mathematics is more likely to yield "rigorous" results. Who says the opposite is true of linguistic grammar? Mathematicians got it "straight" at the beginning of the 20th century; i.e. Frege, Russell, et al) Of course, the very question is the context of arithmetic; is it universal or, like grammar, context-checked? (You've got a solid handle of grammar among your friends, but among prescriptivists? How can we speak of "local mathematics" or regional mathematics? e.g. Vedic mathematics, the nuances between Leibniz-Newton calculuses, etc) But ask yourself, is someone who judges the speed of an arithmetical operation just like someone who judges the quality of grammar in English prose?

Anyway, no one will say that language is the totality of vocabulary, or just an index of names for objects. Individuated numbers came about through the minds ability to declare finites (or inability to perceive the infinite as infinite and make use of it). Our lack of use of the infinite does not imply that our usage of finite numbers (through mathematics) has any value-judgment, by the way. Mathematics is simply a way which we've arbitrarily legitimized to make up the world. The fact that we have seemingly consistent mathematical theories does not show their correlation with the World or the Infinite, but are telling of the way the Human Mind works within the Domain of the Infinite or the World. 

The presupposition that mathematics reflects the Infinite accurately leads to anthropocentric arrogance. In Spinozistic terms, Mathematics is a mode of a mode of a mode. 

Mathematics is a mode of Number whereas Number is a mode Thinking whereas (Human) Thinking is a mode of the attribute of Thought, an expression of Deus sive Natura's absolutely infinite essence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To lionize ourselves against physicality and limitation, we postulate that physical reality cannot achieve certain ends. It is a tragedy--that we aim to insult that which has no <em>obvious</em> voice of its own because of our faulty egos and suffocated minds. Our physical senses qua limitation imply our bias in communicating with Nature. We wholly are egoists. Humans roar, but as brick walls, at the world, "The physical world may wrought the death of my physical because I am so attached to it (ontologically), but I've outsmarted death by the limits of the physical [which I postulate]!" Tell me, are asteroids cognizant of the planets they destroy? <em>Can </em>they care? And <em>can</em> we? This is the concern for morality.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Use of appearances</strong>
<blockquote>Music can teach us how to play but not when or what we ought to play. Reason alone, by virtue of its self-analysis, can tell us the value of itself and of all the other faculties. Hence it determines the proper use of the other faculties, and it makes value judgments.</blockquote>
 "use of appearances" is "the way we receive appearances, test their validity, and relate to them our desires and impulses."

<strong>Immediate knowledge of Appearance</strong>
<blockquote>An appearance expresses accurately the underlying object which it reveals, in such a way that the appearance would not be possible if that object did not exist.</blockquote>

<strong>Mediate knowledge</strong>
Knowledge based on logical (inferential) consequence with <em>appearances</em> as subject matter.

<strong>Stoic freedom</strong>
<blockquote>Freedom is the restriction of one's opinions and hence one's wishes to those things which no one can prevent from happening as he desires.</blockquote>

Free Won't?

<strong>Faculty of Judgment of Desires or Stoic "use of appearances"</strong>
In accordance with concepts (irrespective of objects), to "<em>do or refrain from doing as one pleases.</em>" That is, desire what one finds to be "good" or "evil." We necessarily avoid what we subjectively consider "evil."

<strong>Wish</strong>
<blockquote>[...] If not joined by consciousness of the ability to bring about a desire's object by one's own action</blockquote>

When unaware of the ways in which to bring an object about by one's own action (possibly due to physical limitation, etc).

<strong>Will</strong>
"Faculty of desire whose <em>inner determining ground</em>, hence even what pleases it, lies within the subject's <em>reason.</em> The will itself has no determining ground (no choice); insofar as it can determine choice, it is instead <em>practical reason</em> (pragmatism, wisdom insofar as achieving a certain end based on pure reason's resultants) itself." Not only choice but wish can enter into the will. e.g. My will allows me to choose what I choose and choose what I wish to choose from, despite my unconsciousness of the way in which I can bring about what I wish.

<strong>Pure will</strong>
Kant refers to the will as "pure" in <em>Metaphysics of Morals;</em> however, the term "pure will" is undefined. He states that Human choice is not "pure" because it is "affected but not determined." Effectively, he has said that the power of Human choice sits somewhere between Free choice and Animal choice, yet it is determined to carry out unpure (Truly free?) choice by its pure will (undefined). This is vague and, without exlicit definition, meaningless.

<strong>Choice</strong>
Consciousness of the ability to bring about a desire's object by one's own action (I understand <em>that</em> and <em>how</em>, to some extent, I am physically/mentally capable...etc.)

<strong>Free Choice</strong>
Choice determined by <em>pure reason</em> (theoretical reason).

<strong>Animal choice</strong>
Determine only by inclination, sensible impulse, stimulus, etc.

<strong>Human choice</strong>
Choice affected but not determined by animal choice; therefore, it is not pure (free choice) but can still be determined to actions by "pure will."

<strong>Good Will</strong>
<em>Expected consequences</em> are morally neutral. How can you possibly be held accountable for <em>all</em> of the consequences? (But to what extent can you not be held accountable?) Rational will is restrained to duty; "good will" is a rational will with respect to adhering to a moral duty. (See: Im/perfect duty)

<strong>Duty</strong>
Duty is the necessity to act out of reverence for that law set by a categorical imperative. An act can have moral content iff it is carried out solely with regard to a sense of, or in the name of fulfilling, moral duty. (See: Im/perfect duty)

<strong>Perfect Duty</strong>
<em>Moral duty. </em>We <em>must not</em> act by maxims that result in <em>logical contradictions.</em>

<strong>Imperfect Duty</strong>
<em>Moral duty. </em>We <em>must</em> act by maxims that we would <em>desire to be universalized.</em>

<strong>Imperative Statements</strong>
Any proposition which declares an action to be necessary, given the premises to that proposition.

<strong>Hypothetical Imperatives</strong>
These imperatives are conditional and applicable on a circumstantial basis. Used to achieve ends (satisfy hunger, etc), but are conditionally means themselves (to achieve other ends; e.g. satisfy hunger to sustain oneself).

<strong>First Categorical Imperative</strong>
<blockquote>Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become universal law.</blockquote>

<strong>Second Categorical Imperative</strong>
<blockquote>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means.</blockquote>

<strong>Third Categorical Imperative</strong>
<blockquote>Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.</blockquote>

<strong>Comments</strong>
1 Categorical universalization leads to non-rational choice in that, theoretically, choices within related social-contexts are pre-determined. Imagine filling out an exam that asks you if you should lie in certain situations.
<em>Exam 1:</em> 1. No.; 2. No.; 3. No.; ... n. No., etc.
This denies rational choice to yourself and all those existing in the Kingdom of Ends because, as implied, no one would answer the exam differently. Both perfect and imperfect duty are lost.

2 You piss on person A's lawn. A says, quite sincerely, "I will kill the person who pissed on my lawn, and that persons asks you: Do you know who pissed on my lawn?" If you do not tell him, you deny his capability of engaging in rational choice. If you do tell him, you effectively are committing suicide. Kant's own criticisms of suicide would hold.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>[1] Spinoza deduces many things from his concept of G-D, but one in particilar deserves mention for its central role in subsequent controversies. In Spinoza's world, everything that happens, happens necessarily. One of the most notorious propositions of the Ethics is 1P3: "Things could not have been produced by G-D in any manner or in any order different from that which in fact exists". This is a logical inference from the proposition that the relation of G-D to the world is something like that of an essence to its properties {circle to roundness}: G-D cannot one day decide to do things differently any more than a circle can choose not to be round, or a mountain can forswear the valley that forms on its side. The view that there is a "necessary" aspect of things may be referred to by the sometimes inappropriate name of "determinism:"

[2] Of course, Spinoza acknowledges, in the world we see around us, many things seem to be contingent—or merely possible, and not necessary. That is, it seems that things don't have to be the way that they are: the earth might never have formed; this book might never have been published; and so on. In fact, Spinoza goes on to say, every particular thing in the world is contingent when considered solely with respect to its own nature. In technical terms, he says that "existence" pertains to the essence of nothing—save G-D. Thus, at some level, Spinoza stands for the opposite of the usual caricature of the determinist as reductivist, for, according to his line of thinking, we humans are never in a position to understand the complete and specific chain of causality that gives any individual thing its necessary character; consequently, we will never be in a position to reduce all phenomena to a finite set of intelligible causes, and all things must always appear to us to be at some level radically free. (In this sense, incidentally, he should count as a radical empiricist.) In somewhat less technical terms, we could say that, from a human point of view, everything must always seem contingent; even though from a divine or philosophical point of view, everything is nonetheless necessary. From the philosophical point of view—and only from the philosophical point of view—the distinction between possibility and actuality vanishes: if something may be, it is; if it may not be, it is not.
&mdash;Matthew Stewart's <em>The Courier and the Heretic</em>; 2006</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

I wrote about the Gettier problems a few days ago. I've rethought my arguments against Gettier Case II. To say the least, my attempt then was an utter failure: I messed up my translations to inclusive and exclusive ORs, not realizing that my arguments then were contingent on the validity of those translations as such. However, now I'll make the IOR and XOR argument again, but from an anti-OL philosophy position. It is likely that my undertaking here will, like my previous attack, result in ineffectual nonsense, but there may, nevertheless, be some merit in the arguments that follow.

How things might be said to be different this time around is that, now, I've come to realize my true motivation against the "problem" illustrated by Case II does not center on the internal "problem" of "logic qua knowledge." I was thinking that I could attack the logic "from the inside" and show it to be incoherent as logic, and thus not applicable to knowledge. Now, my argument has more to do with idealized language and the reduction of language to logic for further unrelenting analytic philosophical analysis. When the analytics strong-arm language into the domain of logic, it seems that unfair argument against Platonic language speakers--as if existing; in effect, straw men--dictates, almost certainly, the direction of the analysis. I should say now, I'll be wary of such traps the analytics set, while maintaining, I suppose, some kind of hope that the papers I read in the future do not become rote, nauseating, and boring.

Complaints aside, I should switch gears into making my point. Both inclusive and exclusive ORs turn out true on the truth table; however, it's that semantically these propositions yield different results or have different contexts for usage. Essentially, I think that although OR propositions may be calculated to give true value-assignments, they are epistemically neutral when analyzing human knowledge. These propositions tend to have non-contextual natures in that they speak relevantly about a specific context in a broad sense, but are propositions which are context-limiting yet not internally context-denoting.

If nothing is denoted, not having a specific claim being made about a certain referent, the proposition analyzed cannot be treated as a propositional knowledge-claim. OR propositions usually come of the form A v B, whereas A might be the case or B might be the case. So stated, <em>the case</em> is not actually denoted; <em>cases</em> are given as a context (e.g. "I know about the weather. It can generally be this or that...but not a dragon egg", etc), limiting the relevance of <em>other</em> cases to the knowledge claim.

<strong>On Gettier Case II</strong>

A v B is logically equivalent to -A->B.

(1) Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona.

(1.1) If Jones does not own a Ford then Brown is in Barcelona.

(2) It is raining or it is snowing.

(2.1) If it is not raining then it is snowing.

Now if we look at OR propositions in this way (typically called the 'arrow' derived rule; I can prove it without other derived rules), the question is raised: Does the speaker <em>know</em> the value of the antecedent when he or she speaks it?

Suppose Smith were to say, "If Jones does not own a Ford, then Brown is in Barcelona." Smith <em>must</em> find out if Jones really owns that Ford or not. It can't simply be that Smith would think, as Gettier would like it, "Well, I see him drive a Ford all the time." 

By validly changing the way the statement is uttered, the semantic emphasis is altered. Thus, certain questions become relevant regarding Smith's knowledge. This is my example. If Smith were to say "if [...] then [...]," he'd be making a claim typically about logical inference. However, Smith isn't in the Gettier case. He's just making a JTB knowledge-claim, presumably. But in the form of 1.1, if it is uttered that way (regardless of if it actually shows up in ordinary language, it's logically equivalent! so unless we admit that logical inference presupposes idealized language, we can say it could possibly show up in language), then we'd ask Smith. Seeing as that there's a consequential relationship between the antecedent and consequent, he'd probably feel obligated to at least determine the consequential nature of the proposition. We'd ask what's the truth-value of the antecedent, a pressuring move. Moreover, in this sense of the proposition, he'd come to <em>know</em> that Brown's being in Barcelona contingent upon his knowing that Jones owns a Ford.

Smith is not justified in believing that Jones owns in the case of thinking "If Jones owns a ford..." because the usage of "if" demands that an empirical investigation is taken with seriousness. Not only that, but Smith is further saying "If Jones does <em>not</em> own a Ford..." Posed as the logical equivalent conditional, for Smith to venture into "listing" inferred OR statements, what keeps us from asking, "Why not go further and check the truth value of the antecedent?"

Gettier seems to believe that "logically justified inference" is tantamount to "justified belief." But we all know that we do not intuitively think in terms of logical inference alone. We impose logic on our thinking, not the other way around. Logic has nothing to gain from perpetuating its usage. Most of our lives, we think illogically.

Furthermore, so stated as the logically equivalent conditional, why, at all, would Smith think that Brown's being in Barcelona is even contingently and consequentially relevant to Jones' owning a Ford? They're of different categories. (2) and (2.1) at least refer to the same thing, the weather. Typically, it doesn't rain when it snows.

(3) Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona, or Jones owns a Ford and Brown is in Barcelona. (IOR)

This is obviously epistemically unjustified. Smith just rattled off a list. So, he couldn't possibly know A & B, even if it is an included OR. He wouldn't even think of knowing it, only hypothesizing it. He would have no justification in believing an inclusive.

(4) Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona, and it is not the case that Jones owns a Ford and Brown is in Barcelona. (XOR)

Again, why would he make any sort of <em>and</em> claim if he just rattled off a list of possibilities? He'd never possibly know them unless he checked. And he couldn't be epistemically justified based on the inference because the list was just conjured up. If he thought of <em>and</em> at all, he'd ask himself, "Do I know this?" So he would have to <em>increase the inner determining</em> (to use Kant's strength of will; think "strength of justification" to one's self) ground of his justification. He'd have to raise the bar on what he's justified in believing. Gettier seems to think he can just do it for the sake of argument...raise the bar to the maximal belief justification, regardless of the proposition's phrasing and semantic persuasion. As if language is like the geometric figures the Cartesians believed they could impose upon Nature.

Analytic philosophers are committing the same mistake they accused, and probably still accuse, many of the metaphysicians before Kant (or really before the Vienna Circle). They're importing nonexistent (linguistic) constructs that do not actually grasp anything real about the world.

I'll rethink Gettier Case I and Gettier Cousin Case III later; I'll further consider my overall attack on the unnatural "language" the analytics have been using for their expositions of philosophical discourse. Perhaps I'm completely off the mark.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If religion, in your eyes, is truly not the problem, then it must be just as easy to say that, <em>that it is not</em>, as it is to say that it is the problem. In effect, you've defended nothing against the assertion for nothing. Religion will not weep if it discovers these rumors, and religion will not parade when humanity falls for good. So when we say "religion does this" do we not truly mean "religious people do this"? Which religious people? Where? When? Why? How did it come about that they could?

Avoid this distancing language! Stop making category mistakes! Religion is nothing, and it does nothing. Stop speaking as if it were a person, and start talking about people!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The most perverse argument of the free-marketeers, led by the Economist, is that fair trade distorts the market. The reason most coffee farmers can't make a decent living, for example, is that they are producing too much. Rather than keeping over-production going by encouraging farmers to join fair-trade schemes, we should let the market send out its signals so that they grow something more profitable instead.

The trouble with this argument is that fair trade is a triumph of the free market. It works not because it subsidises goods no one wants, but because relatively rich consumers are willing to support a scheme that guarantees certain benefits to producers. Unlike the huge subsidies paid to farmers by the EU and the US, it is about matching demand for produce that helps the poor with its supply.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a neighborhood whore-cat with three feet whom I gave a flea collar today. I do not know why his left hind foot is missing; we could speculate all day on the possibilities.

There's another cat who spied on me, peeping through a kitchen window. Perhaps it was interested in the human activity or looking for a meal?

Both cats have given me much to think about. The former repeatedly attempts to scratch itself with its missing foot. Does it know the foot is not there? It responds as if its itch (fleas) has been removed; it has not learned that the end-effect of scratching does not follow from the scratching itself. The cat may be preconditioned to custom (continued scratching with the phantom limb) regardless of causal ineffectuality. Imagine a cat with no limb, scratching with "it." Imagine a human...

The latter cat--the investigator--was looking for something. Food, perhaps? But what did it learn from my opening the door? It learned, possibly, that I was not a familiar face. But it seemed to be on its way to the fence before I had the door open--this would suggest that it knew a familiar face was not going to open the door. If so, then the cat must have not been only in search of food. It may have had another object in mind. Was it simply curious? But of what?

Could it be that the window gave it a false sense of security? Did it believe it could not be seen perhaps? It must have known that, to some degree, it was protected by distance and barrier. What did it learn from that encounter?

What do phantom limbs say about <em>knowing</em> whether one has those limbs in every possible world? What does this say about objective knowledge claims? That cat subjectively <em>knows</em> (in the sense that it functions as if it did have it) that it has a left hind foot. There may be a difference in epistemic value between asking if one knows p and inferring that one knows p by their actions. Which form of "knowing" should epistemologists direct their attention? Can the two forms of knowing be complements or are they mutually exclusive? (Or at least independent forms?)

By JTB, you ask; but could one's actions as if "knowing" replace JTB all together? Clearly by JTB, the cat is justified <em>by</em> only a mysterious physiological configuration. Where does physiological knowing fit into JTB? How is intuition related to our physiology? p [I have a hind left foot] is false; but if we play with the proposition a bit, broadening the context... I'm at a loss right now for an example. But! In the cat's mind, that which is believed is true, false or not considered. Since it continues to scratch with it, p cannot be false. The cat may simply be deluded. Can we even say that cats believe propositions? Or, more generally, that non-human animals have beliefs?]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hume says that "matters of fact" are not rationally or logically inferred; any isolated "fact" will be derived from another "fact," and so on ad infinitum. The process itself, by which we derive that next fact is not a priori, a mere relation between ideas, logically deduced, etc. The sun may not rise tomorrow because its rising tomorrow is a contingent truth. We base our argument for its rising on "sound" probability or something else equally meaningless, unrigorous, unphilosophical, etc. Hume argues, however, that all <em>matters of fact</em> formulate in our minds due to "customary conjunction." New day, Sun's back. Nothing logical about that. You cannot infer from "New day" that "Sun's back" follows necessarily or logically. In short, the sun, as said, may not rise tomorrow, for any number of reasons the Universe might throw at us. Further, the sun's rising and its being a new day are not causally dependent; these two events are only matters of fact which stand temporally side-by-side.

Look at the logical form of the infamously charged "bad reasoning": If D, then S.

But Hume says it's more like: D & S (over a long period of D and S hanging out side by side, or by "contiguity," as Hume puts it).

At first, I was thinking Hume meant something like Not-[D & Not-S]. This would appeal more to the probabilistic or scientific agenda. It's the negative approach scientists take when "weeding out" hypotheses. D & S would lead scientists, I suppose, on ghost hunts <em>for a bit longer.</em>

The interesting part is this: D & S entails D > S; and Not-[D & Not-S] entails D > S.

A proof of the latter:

<blockquote><code>-(D&-S) Assum.
D Prov.
-S Prov.
D&-S Conj. Add.
-(D&-S) Reit.
S Reductio.
D>S Cond.</code></blockquote>

The former is simple enough.

I find it curious that we pick out inferences based on "customary conjunction" and establish them as "logical." Well, maybe that's not so interesting. Hume already said it's ill-founded when we do this. 

But! If we can show that "custom" precedes "inference," wouldn't that mean our basis for adopting Modus Ponens as a basic rule of logic is also ill-founded? "Logic" wouldn't be "pure" but only pragmatic (that is, nihilistic).

Or, to perhaps be less vulgar about it--<em>logic is Kantian transcendental</em>, like space and time.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>It is before all things useful to men to associate their ways of life, to bind themselves together with such bonds as they think most fitted to gather them all into unity, and generally to do whatsoever serves to strengthen friendship.
But for this there is need of skill and watchfulness. For men are diverse (seeing that those who live under the guidance of reason are few), yet are they generally envious and more prone to revenge than to sympathy. No small force of character is therefore required to take everyone as he is, and to restrain one's self from imitating the emotions of others. But those who carp at mankind, and are more skilled in railing at vice than in instilling virtue, and who break rather than strengthen men's dispositions, are hurtful both to themselves and others.
&mdash;<em>Ethics</em>, Part IV, Appendix, 12 &ndash; 13</blockquote>

<blockquote>To give aid to every poor man is far beyond the power and the advantage of any private person. For the riches of any private person are wholly inadequate to meet such a call. Again, an individual man's resources of character are too limited for him to be able to make all men his friends. Hence providing for the poor is a duty, which falls on the State as a whole, and has regard only to the general advantage.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Save your child, or save 10 people; but not both. Decide.</blockquote>

Arbitrarily "choosing" a moral system by which to test game show ethical "dilemmas" such as this would not yield the "right" or "good" answer; demanding a moral system by which to gauge the goodness of an act yields completely to relativism. We might as go play Monopoly at Steve's for an hour, then go play at Susan's for another, tenants vanishing as quickly as your humanity.

Contemporary Ethics is about Criticizing older moral system in an attempt to better understand your own choices in life; moral systems are not themselves right or wrong, nor is any event which occurs under that moral system's purview. It would be a pointless endeavor to ask "What would Kant do?" Why not ask, "What would Joe from Accounting would do?" Whereas with the former, you delude yourself into "understanding" simply because you've read some convoluted prose on the metaphysical matters. The latter just gives you something equally insipid and irrelevant. Criticize Kant and Joe the same.

Systematic ethics (deontic, utilitarian) robs us of our humanity--we are not automata. Deontic ethics reduces to faith in our own rationality, something we have no justification for having faith in for epistemic limitation, acculturation, alienation, etc will forever be at our doorstep. Deontic ethics attempts to turn us into our own little deities, and this is absurd by definition. Utilitarian ethics is a joke; it cannot judge itself the best ethical system, but yet it is logically possible that qua system, it might not yield the greater (great<strong>est</strong>? This is absurd nonsense) happiness. Do we really have time to calculate all ethical systems against one another before the train smashes everyone to bits? Virtue ethics was not Meant to address "game show ethics" such as the original post, so it can be ignored.

Let us define our terms. Are we entirely automata like how people tend to think of animals and computers? Yes. Can we say exactly that our natures are identical to animals and computers? No. Even if dogs were to pick up philosophy, their philosophy would be automata to us--and yet, part of their habit is still interesting to us. Their philosophy would be their habit which would be unique. Our own human habit is interesting to us. We cannot completely describe ourselves as "automata" to one another. That remainder, which cannot be put to paper, is our "humanity."

Evidence will do no good, since you see that I am not talking about "humans are so cool! they've got rationality and free will!!" Because of epistemic conditioning (Humean Skepticism), we are forced, as a species, to consider everything outside of our species as "automata"; the world ticks and tocks with or without us. Though Hume's Skepticism points out our use of custom or habit, we cannot say our custom or habit is exactly like that of a dog or a computer.

Game Show Ethics should be rejected outright as Platonic Douchebaggery. If you reject Platonic Realism, you will reject any "idealized ethics incident." Simply because it's asked in an ethics class does not therefore make it an ethical concern. Applied Ethics presupposes society, and society entails that some therein will idle and reflect on how society could be better (ethics), generally. Therefore, nothing is isolated and the only granted assumption should be that which defines your society and its broadness, its extent.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Counter I</strong>
Smith cannot make the inference "Jones has" to "The man has" without maintaining all the properties and referent (Jones) of the first conjunction-proposition. The inference itself is the problem. (1) I cannot imagine why in any real world scenario he'd make anything like it, and even if he did, it would be peculiar. Thus, Gettier can be accused of committing what I call Platonic Language. The inference itself, so stated, is contrived and too Form-like to be seriously considered. (2) Smith is not epistemically entitled to make any inference not necessarily referring to Jones. So Jones is thinking "some man, such that there is only one man"; well, is he not still thinking of Jones? Yes, the inference is valid for us, as observers of Smith's situation, but for Smith, he'd need justification to at all include himself as a possibility of getting the job, which is what his inference (2) implies. 

"Smith's evidence for (d) might be that the president of the company assured him that Jones would in the end be selected"; here, he receives possibly the strongest evidence available. So why would he still believe he's even a likely candidate? My hunch is that we must further assume that Smith is the most optimistic thinker on the planet in order to accept his inference (2). That being said, wouldn't most of us consider jettisoning, rather than making awkward and for-the-sake-of-argument inferences? 

<strong>Counter II</strong>
"Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona" is logically equivalent to "If Jones does not own a Ford, then Brown is in Barcelona". 



<blockquote>(1:Assum.) FvB 
(2: Provisional Assum.) -F 
(3:Provisional Assum.) -B 
(4:DeMorgan's) -(-F&-B) 
(5:Conj) -F&-B 
(6:Conj) [-(-F&-B)] & [-F&-B] 
(6:Reductio) B 
(7:Conditional Proof) -F->B </blockquote>

<blockquote>(1:Assum) -F -> B 
(2:Prov. Assum) -(FvB) 
(3:DeMorgan's) -F&-B 
(4:Conj. Out) -F 
(5:Conj. Out) -B 
(6:Modus) B 
(7:Conj) -B&B 
(8:Reductio) FvB </blockquote>

So, I pull the "possible worlds" card. In a nearby possible world, Smith says (2) "If Jones does not own a Ford, then Brown is in Barcelona." I highly doubt I even need to play the possible worlds card since Gettier is making awkward inferences and brute-forcing logic into the way the mind thinks. Perhaps not a possible world? I say it is logically possible for Smith to actually utter (2). If he can't, I'd sure like to see why it is that he can't. 

My point is this, given the logically equivalent item (2), why would Smith at all consider Jones' ownership of a Ford consequentially relevant to Brown's being in Barcelona? More generally, how in any way is Brown's being in Barcelona conditioned by Jones' owning or not owning of a Ford? 

Which kind of "OR" proposition is this? Inclusive or Exclusive? In either case, why would Smith feel entitled to know if Brown is in Barcelona? Sure, the inference is logically possible, but Smith is epistemically restricted to his own evidence. Either OR-type highlights the awkwardness of the inference; he couldn't possibly think himself justified in saying anything about actual Brown's location. He can only rattle off a list of possibilities; this does not implicate knowledge. The propositions are neither true nor false, but meaningless for Smith; thus, they are useless to Gettier's project. Smith's being right in the end is irrelevant because he had no epistemic justification for his inference, only rule-logical justification. Well, if he's going to play the rules of logic that way, as said earlier, it must be further argued why Smith cannot, in the first place, utter (2) (the If...Then... proposition).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Smith believes "Jones has" because the property of Jones MUST track for Smith (i.e. predicate-logic: Mj). Sure, the proposition is TRUE by existential introduction for the purposes of "God's eye view," but for Smith, the proposition must necessarily include Jones and not himself. (a) Jones is necessarily the referent for Smith but not necessarily for us. Now, the question must be asked: What is the relationship of JTB and an external observer? Further, how can we say that because "the man" is imposed on Smith that he believes it? Yes, it is TRUE, I reiterate, for us reading the paper because we can play with logical inference, but we are talking about a supposedly real person with Internal Beliefs. We cannot just play some logical ninjitsu while expecting someone to hold necessarily generalizations (Existential Introduction) as their beliefs. 

Sure, the new proposition ("The Man...") is True and (Logically) Justified...but does Smith actually believe it? Gettier says "suppose Smith sees the entailment"... 

THIS is what needs an argument, and Gettier does not provide it. In what way does he see its entailment? Why does he see it? What reason does he have for "seeing" it? Did he actually make it himself (Smith), or is Gettier just imposing it for the sake of argument? At the end, after successfully winning the job, would Smith reflect on his proposition and count himself as having had known it? Is that a philosophical question? Or can only external minds judge the knowledge of others? Can a mind never judge its own knowledge? 

Again, the proposition of case I is certainly true and logically justified, but--"that existential generalization remains a True Justified Logical Inference that Smith believes..." In what way does he believe it? It's never stated in the paper that he believes it, only that he sees the entailment. Furthermore, my argument still stands; recognize the gist of it: 

Smith has made a generalization (by EI); in order to make such a generalization, it has to be a true generalization. It has to be a statement about the state of affairs which encompasses more than just a particular. However, my argument has been that Smith's belief MUST TRACK. Why do I say this? Well, what has Smith made an Existential Introduction about? Well, he's made one based off of a particular. Generally existential quantifiers stand for "some," "at least one," etc. Now, consider the (vague) situation Gettier set up. For all we know, Smith and Jones are the only candidates for the job. My argument has been that Smith cannot possibly be considering himself as the likely candidate to get it. The evidence for Jones is too strong. Thus, Gettier makes, and Smith "sees," entailment based on EXACTLY ONE token, and only one token. For Smith's knowledge-claim proposition, not only MUST his belief track, but the entailed proposition ("The man...") can only function as a grammatical transposition. Not only must his belief track, but his belief cannot do anything but (as far as we, as outside observers can tell) zero in on Jones. 

Okay, ignore this... It's possible they're not the only ones. However, I still think issue needs to be raised with the nature of existential introduction. I suppose we could say "Jones, Smith, and only other men were applying for a job." I do not think the Gettier argument works, however, if Jones and Smith are the ONLY men applying. 

Furthermore, whoever founded the idea that "beliefs" and "logic" correspond at all? Couldn't beliefs simply be expressions of one's attitude? That said, one's attitude could toss off any old list for Case II, and if Brown were not located at any city on that finite list? This is not the point, though. I would grant that beliefs will be subjected to truth and falsity, but who established the notions of truth and falsity necessarily are governed by the rules of logical inference. I suppose I may come off as a Humean Skeptic here, but, they're OUR rules of logical inference. Who's to say our beliefs must answer to our logic rather than our logic to our beliefs? 

<a href="http://www.moving-finger.com/papers/gettier.pdf">http://www.moving-finger.com/papers/gettier.pdf</a>

That second argument in that paper fails to understand how disjunction inclusion propositions work. 

Smith is justified in believing P; now he has a proposition going. 

By disjunctive inclusion, Smith gets P or Q. 

-P is the case; therefore, Q. 

By logic, this is how it works: 

P or Q 
-P 
Therefore, Q 

However, Smith was never justified in believing Q. He caught its truth by accident. However, if you accept that later evidence governs Smith's JTB, the falsity of P (by logic) somehow (outside of Smith's mind) determines that Q is true. Smith never sees this intimate relationship between P and Q, but in order for him to infer Q at all he must see that P and Q are related in some way. 

The idea Gettier wants to get across is that Smith got P or Q and believed that by disjunctive inclusion. Who knows why people would believe a whole disjunctive argument; it's not "believable" in principle. It's a dichotomous context builder. Disjunctive inclusion INCREASES the number of those you possibly believe; believing a disjunctive proposition itself requires that one explain how the disjuncts are related. Even then, believing the proposition on the whole makes the belief a tautology. For a believer, a tautology can never become falsified. The OR-proposition for Smith becomes a tautology. If you consider the OR proposition as Inclusive or Exclusive, this would require you to ask why Smith would feel epistemically justified in believing P&Q or, exclusively, Not-[P&Q]. Considering these form of OR-propositions, Smith's epistemic justified becomes empty. He has no justified at all for considering that P& Brown is wherever is at all entitled to his knowledge. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Humean Skepticism shows us that we do not directly perceive causality. 

"Mind" is a postulate we make because we often associate our actions with some agency. We cannot pinpoint what that agency, or consciousness, is, but we postulate it because we believe it makes human freedom and our actions intelligible. However, consciousness is not something perceivable; we do not perceive causality; therefore, we do not "see" how we are causal agents. Nor do we perceive the faculty of agency (consciousness). 

Consciousness is possible because we postulate it; by induction and observation, we more or less clarify what qualities and effects pertain to consciousness (e.g. "love" pertains whereas "purple banana" does not; choosing a fast food chain pertains whereas dying from natural causes does not, etc). 

We play the association by proximity of temporality game (like Hume says) with consciousness/mind/soul/etc. We do things, and because of our ignorance we do not know the true causation involved. So, we give a word to that event. We call it a "mental" or "consciousness" event; however, these are just words with no (empirical) referent. And they cannot be deduced by logical deduction because not only is logic a product of "association by proximity" which, as a discourse of human cognition, is a product of "consciousness" (this would be presuppositional and circular reasoning), but what's more, the laws of logic cannot solely infer the existence of any particular thing. Logic requires content; content does not require logic. If I want to deductively infer my own mind, I would not have enough premisses (content; e.g. data, awareness of my history, causes, etc) to do so. 

It'd be best to call "consciousness" "awareness (perceivability) mixed with memory and reasoning."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The word "begin" and the concept of "beginning" presuppose a conceptual framework which gives them their meaning, a cognitively meaningful status. The statement "it begins" has a semantic dependency on concept "time" qua conceptual framework. Time makes "beginning" intelligible, not the other way around. Asking "When did time begin?" or asserting "Time had to begin" is meaningless. 

When words, arranged in a certain way, yield a grammatically valid statement, proposition or question we should not expect that the same statement, proposition or question is necessarily semantically valid. We should often be on guard against such subtle enemies to philosophy. How to abuse the term: assert "everything has a beginning; time has a beginning because it is a <em>thing</em>". 

No, time is not a "thing"; "time" <em>exists</em> as an meta-entity (an strictly elucidatory "object") which makes all experiential (and actual) things intelligible to our senses. The same goes for space, matter, and motion. These "objects" depend on one another to bear for themselves any sort of ontological status within the domain of reality. Beyond these terms, there is no sense. Typically, we call them "modes of thinking."

Asking "When did time begin?" is like asking "How did matter come from absolutely nothing" (ex nihilo)? The question cannot be asked; it only collapses meaning-wise. Matter (something) and nothingness are terms which only make sense when defined in terms of each other; therefore, they cannot refute one another. "What time was it during non-time?" With time and beginning; as said, the concept "time" gives "beginning" its sense.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ethics as a Linguistic Dilemma</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a hunch: there's a deficiency on our ascription of moral blame to "agents." More specifically, there's a semantic double standard that is employed when we describe a moral situation and the entities involved.

Primarily, when we speak of morality, a context is formed; typically, we "know" when we're talking about something moral and when we are not. Topics of "murder" become moral concerns; the words we use in such a case are "responsibility," "accountability," and so forth. But, "natural" incidents cannot be held accountable or responsible in the way we use such terms within an "intuitively known" moral context. A tree cannot be held to blame for tipping over and crushing someone.

My argument here is not against moral facts; you can have them. However, if the context which dictates whether or not an incident is a moral dilemma is known "intuitively," then this must mean that when we begin to employ terms describing the moral concern a linguistic modality is instantiated. Words, terms, phrases, etc all of a sudden become morally imbued. We are quick to see the equivocation; but yet, where did it come from? We suddenly start "talking morally" because of some arbitrary and immeasurable "feeling" which screams "that is moral!"

If there is no describable criterion which compels us into the moral sphere, where language becomes "moral," would this mean that we accept linguistic modality? What if someone is epistemically unacquainted with a certain linguistic mode for morality; or less so than most?

This seems to show that moral intuitionism is a more accurate statement of human morality since our intuitions govern the linguistic modes by which we arbitrarily believe that we are discussing something "moral" (and thus equivocating terms).]]></content:encoded>

1) Yes, I find dissatisfaction with it because the use of moral language, I feel, must have originated in some objective context. For example, we started calling people morally corrupt because they took too much of their share of the meat from the previous hunt. But what is so immoral about that? That they were unaware of this somehow "objective" signpost which tells everyone their maximum take? To make the distinction between blameworthy/praiseworthy and accidental/uncontrollable only further adds to the confusion. Further, it does not even address the question of "why" certain events can even be considered moral in any sense. The point is that it becomes arbitrary and introduces inconsistency to say "well, humans are never moral or immoral in the sphere of accident/uncontrollable"; why would that be? We might have to sack our belief that we are natural or that we can observe ourselves in naturalistic frameworks of observation like sociology, psychology, etc. I'm fine with saying humans cannot be "accidentally moral or immoral" but it is so counterintuitive to think that. We know that we have moral luck--but to what extent does moral luck govern all moral events? It's quite easy to believe, for me, that every moral event is a lucky one, driven by our intuitions. Of course, that requires me to explain how I make sense of an inherently morally lucky universe. What sense is there in saying the universe is morally lucky in the andromeda galaxy (for all sentient beings therein)? I have a feeling, though, that intelligence in other realms of the universe might see our "morality" in a different sense, something completely awkward and alien to our own. The conditions for moral import, that is, would be radically different. Asking "do you queer aliens accept killing?" would never satisfy a moral understanding; their conditions for killing in the spheres of permissibility and obligation, however, would be what strike us as outstanding and novel.

2) Your argument I willingly accept; however, my question did not aim at education. Indeed, there is gradation of moral import, moral excellence and depravity across every demographic. This, for one, is our problem to make absolute sense of why moral import is so relative in a linguistic sense. What does courage mean for a burglar and for a corporate tycoon? The differences almost grasp equivocation, making their different notions of the conditions of courageous action radical when compared. But this is a goal for sociologists. My question here is not about culture but something possibly scientific. I am seeing "linguistic modality of moral language" in the same way that we see "ability to learn language at all" or "the ability to pick up on social cues." I see, perhaps, a "faculty" for all inner determining of modalities. This faculty can be physical in the sense that, if it were damaged or varying between people, one might perceive the mode more readily than the other. Or, someone might not even be able to pick up on the mode of moral language at all. Think in psychophysical terms of the "amoralist" of Bernard Williams' "Introduction to Morality."

3) Let's seek and find out!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>The Myth of a Nation&#039;s Morality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Beyond mere political requirement and commitment, a person might argue that, under the assumption of being a "wealthy nation," it is morally obligatory for the United States to assist neighboring or foreign nations in improving the standard of living of their citizens. The position of this paper will be that there is no “beyond” or “outside” political obligation when we speak in reference to a nation's obligations. More specifically, moral obligations, when we speak in terms of human ethics, I will argue, only apply to human beings who bear what we might call “moral agency.” The argument will carry the implication that “moral agency,” if applied to nations, abuses the semantic wealth of moral language as a means for expressing <em>blame</em> or <em>praise</em> of a moral agent. I will draw upon Immanuel Kant’s concept of “autonomous will” found in his <em>Foundations for the Metaphysics of Morals</em> to support my argument that “moral agency” only applies to human beings. I will further draw upon John Stuart Mill’s “greatest happiness principle” as a minor refutation of my own argument, but I will show that it does not satisfactorily refute my argument because of what will be discussed as regards “moral agency.” During my discussions of Mill and Kant, I will provide a brief summary pertaining to how their ideas interact with my own on the topic of moral obligations of wealthy nations.

When I assign moral agency to any one thing (especially an aggregate of entities; i.e. nations) that assignment or attribution presupposes that I wish to speak persuasively, employing moral language as my means, about the nature of that moral agent and of where blame or praise lie. First, we must ask <em>What definition of morality am I working with?</em> Morality here is being defined as the principle of what ought to be done by a moral agent should that moral agent have a properly established placement of values. This should sufficiently links the two common notions of morality as being either a system of “ought claims on the behavior” or “value-judgments on the behavior.”

<em>What exactly is a moral agent?</em> One might argue that ambiguity stirs because a nation can have values, in a general albeit misleading sense. My definition stated above seems to open the floodgates to a slew of ought-claims based on arbitrary values. Clearly, something else is required for morality. For example, the United States commits itself, problematically so for some public figures, to abstaining from and denouncing as morally reprehensible the use of torture. This shows a statement of <em>value</em>, and what is suggested by that value is a corresponding <em>ought</em>—that we ought to prevent torture where we see it, that we ought not to utilize torture for whatever reason, etc. These ought claims carry implicitly the value held of human life; if you cherish human life, you ought not to commit atrocities against it.

Let us get back to moral agency. In principle, to who is a moral agent accountable and responsible? Can a moral agent answer to itself? To illustrate, suppose you read in the newspaper of a new, experimental jury selection method, “a sufficiently evidenced serial killer is to be entrusted as the sole member of her own jury.” To sharpen what is being denoted here, let us view a jury proper: it is a concatenation of people with negligibly dissimilar values, which echo, by means of a jury room calculus, a unified, resultant value, a judgment. Now suppose in a different newspaper, you notice a trend: “enlisted in a jury were a significant number of repeat misdemeanor offenders.” The similar psychological penchant of jury and defendant is a major concern for most of us; we intuitively bear that feeling of birds of like feathers flocking together. Now in terms of wealthy nations, the arbiter of moral requirements would be that nation’s own population, its own jury. Praise would be given unto itself, whereas in daily living your peers, family, community and so on praise this way or blame that way by employing moral language ( “praise” and “blame”), expressing moral opinion.


You might intuitively feel hesitant to trust such novel methods of seeking justice. That hesitation has certain implications which are relevant to my argument. In terms of Immanuel Kant’s notion of autonomous will, we see exactly why one cannot be one’s own jury. A jury involves multiple persons who bear distinguishable values. The autonomous will, however, gains moral import by dutifully following self-imposed and universalized maxims based on one’s own subjective experiences combined with their rationality. The importance here is the notion of the subjective. When we speak of subjectivity of mind, we speak of human subjectivity and human mind. It would be unintelligible to speak of the “subjective” of a nation. How might an entire nation instantiate a categorical imperative and follow it dutifully?

Even if a nation were to possess “autonomous will,” it could not possess it in any likeness but of sharing the name when compared to its atomic constituents, its citizens, human beings. That being most basic and atomic to a nation is not the definition of moral agency, but in the sense in which the words “autonomy” and “will” are used to apply to persons, these words cannot possess the same semantic preoccupations. From here, we see that distinction between moral agency of persons and moral agency of nations; further, clarification of terms shows the latter notion does not carry clear meaning. This lack of meaning further shows that speaking in terms of moral obligation of nations does not carry any meaningful moral weight because the semantic preoccupation of moral agency only applies to human beings.

Two counterarguments might be raised. First, only as a constituent of a wealthy nation can one raise this argument, and, adding to that, it comes off as markedly relativistic. My interpretation of this argument is that I am claiming constituents cannot argue about moral requirements from within. The strength of the argument, however, is not that being one’s own jury or playing a significant role in one’s own jury is reflexive reasoning, a reflection of value to oneself—something easily perceivable as circular. Even if it is, the point of the argument is the semantic identity of “morality” and “agency” becomes abused. By semantic identity, I mean the identification of moral concerns as chiefly arising between people. We simply cannot talk about “moral agency” or “moral requirements” of a nation. However, we can still see to assisting every world-inhabitant, persons foreign or native, as strictly politically and economically within our purview. We can speak sensibly of helping these impoverished peoples, insofar as a nation’s obligation, whatever that obligation might entail, in terms of a nation’s language, which is not moral language.

The second argument is the <em>greatest happiness principle’s</em> implication that a wealthy nation ought to concern itself with the net happiness of the world. But our arguments above displace the notion of moral obligation for nations, putting it back to where it belongs, in the sphere of human interaction where, furthermore, it is semantically and morally meaningful. There is no reason to suppose that pleasure cannot be obtained for whatever number simply because the intention of a nation is to attend to people as strictly political and economic constituents. The utilitarian calculus could add taxpayer dollars as a variable into the overall calculation; this would produce successive projections of future net happiness totals. Taxpayer dollars is an economic concern, not a moral one; that we should have values at all is not itself a variable in a calculus that we perceive ostensibly and use, nor should it be assumed that having values at all is a utilitarian concept.

Moral concerns pertain specifically to human-to-human interaction; when we speak of helping another, we do so in terms of human moral intuition, empathy, pity, etc. My arguments raised above are an attempt to preserve what gives human beings, i.e. moral agents, their moral identity in the first place, without letting non-rational entities such as nations commit violence to meaning in the sphere of morality. In effect, phrases like “a nation’s pity” and “a city’s intuitions” become patently senseless, and we should avoid them. When my fellows and I wish to help other human beings, near or far, we do so as a “collection.” We might give our collection a name or a label, but we are acting in agreement. That agreement we share does not imply our moral reasons, or even our moral intuitions, are necessarily the same. Therefore, we should not speak of or refer to the label we band under as possessing any moral characteristic that is particularly human.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Moral Relativism and Toleration</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1</strong> Opponents to moral relativism often raise this argument, with aim to draw out and undermine a certain "hidden" premise: moral relativism presupposes a universal <em>Principle of Objective Tolerance.</em>

<strong>2</strong> This argument arises successfully only if the opponent to moral relativism construes the moral relativist as one making ought-claims, rather than arguing as a moral descriptivist inasmuch as the concept of "tolerance" is involved.

<strong>3</strong> In asserting the truth of relativism, one does not presuppose the Principle of Objective Tolerance. Tolerance itself can be mapped onto moral language, as if a "thick" moral term. I might say that "tolerance" is a meta-moral term. Under the descriptivist framework, "tolerance" might function in gauging the <em>conduct </em>and <em>manner of relation</em> between members (persons) of a collection (societies) of all moral systems/cultures (globe).

<strong>3.1</strong> We can get mixed up when we say, "Susan of culture A is kind of relativist; she values tolerance; she thinks people of unique moral systems ought to be tolerant" and think that this person, Susan, is only a difference in degree to a person of this type: "A moral relativist philosopher sees that some moral systems have "tolerance" placed somewhere in their system of values; she sees that some moral systems praise tolerance or shun intolerance".

<strong>3.2</strong> A moral relativist is not always a moral prescriptivist. "Tolerance" might be objective in that, as a meta-moral descriptive term which describes relation, it is universally and objectively present. We can employ a "tolerance calculus," so to speak, and give certain "labels of tolerance" to certain moral systems/cultures. In order to attack the Principle of Objective Tolerance as an ought-claim, the opponent must first point out where exactly it has been advanced as an ought-claim.

<strong>3.3</strong> The point of standing firmly by moral relativism is that if all language can be construed as moral language, then moral language is relative to values of a social or cultural group. Words themselves have no perfect correspondence to any value, but words act as expressive manifestations of value-judgments. The values are "intuitively calculated" whereas the input variables are, as far as we know, infinite. That "tolerance" <em>is often praised</em> across Western cultures does not imply that "tolerance," when philosophers speak of it in ethics, is something <em>which ought to be</em> believed in.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[False analogies exist--the argument from design [of watches] saw a metanarrative of Mechanism to its highest plateau. Is the argument from design monist or dualist?--A meaningless inquiry, and yet here we are. Some attempt a metanarrative by analogy, but, most times, these subtle tricks the "wise" handle do exactly what they were meant to do: explain something mundane, something practical, something meta-nothing! Analogies are used to relate something insipid to something uncharted and new, and with a minor degree of falsity, a successful connection is made. Down the chains of history, droll and profound analogies travel the sociolinguistic lines of probability of thriving. We might contemplate their ventures through unwary cultures, infiltrating norms, disrupting traditions--like rogues of meaning but containers of knowledge!

<em>Agnosis</em> permeates the cracks of public discourse; between each proposition masked in putative profundity there bleeds our dopey intellectual Oedipus. And <em>who </em>we blame is the <em>mind </em>while the <em>brain </em> absorbs us so, some of us to the bitter myopia of reductionism. Reified become our toys and childhood friends and our academic endeavors--in principle, so too our principles. Consigned to domains of idiocy become the cracks ostensible to our immature observations; we breed atheists who chide foolishly at the ghosts of the theists who rebuke no one but their imagined selves. Our private analogies please us not at all, and we look to battered knowledge from friends of friends. We pray that the analogy might convey something <em>real</em>, to place us within something definite and fixed. But I am afraid that too many misanalogies have been fed to us; we might call this human abuse, a form of child abuse. Now we suffer our own idle whines like wounded postmoderns.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Against the Golden Rule</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Golden Rule fails because the <em>criterion</em> you might have for who qualifies as "stupid" (deserving of your "moral wisdom" through moral action or through the content of your speech acts) is <em>not </em>cognitively forthcoming and therefore possibly unjustified by the moral standards of those who you've helped or will help. Epistemically, something is dubious; there's a <em>practical assumption</em> of yours quivering over their unforeseen moral grounds. On the road of moral action, propositions proper do not become situated behind the wheel.

For you, "impiety" is <em>this,</em> and "piety" is <em>that.</em> For another person, "impiety" might be your <em>that,</em> and "piety" might be your <em>this.</em> Moral of the story: you end up doing "unto others" based on a set of values that they do not willingly or consciously consent to; you end up "steering the stupid" because you <em>assume</em> they're "stupid" about <em>your </em>morality. Where is the definite "hurrah!" for a serious moral connection? Where do we even begin to look for it?

Do you learn morality like you learn mathematics? No; it ain't so clear-cut and objective. Do you have a formal training in ethics? No; and even if you did, "stupids" can be moral just the same as graduates in ethics.

"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" as a moral principle assumes that "what you would have them do unto you" is what "they would have done unto themselves" when that is not necessarily the case. Our moral propositions are built on a bridge of possibility; my hunch versus yours.

The Golden Rule is for herd morality. I will see everywhere as an outright contradiction: “I’ve got the Golden Rule! It’s personally mine; I am now justified!”

We're all well aware of the self-deprecating habit we might have due to our own principles and the inconsistency those principles introduce as regards our humanity. A priest would probably have a witch burned at the stake to "rid her of evil spirits," and all the same, as a priest, he'd have himself burned at the stake if he thought that was the only option to rid himself of spirits, thus protecting his family and community. But where are the "witches?" 

I wish not to dwell on extreme cases. However, this hyperbole, and many others like it, do show that, in principle, the Golden Rule <em>so stated</em> explicitly fails. You might think that you adhere to the Golden Rule, but, if you do, you're only giving it lip service <em>when you say that you do.</em> The Golden Rule must be shown, not stated like some wizard of the Weave. Even then, wizards read and follow scrolls, and in doing so, spells are cast more or less perfectly. This is the grammar of morality.

In the ears of charming faces who wish to “see” your “inner” markings (just how human you are!), what is <em>shown</em> is nothing of how you say you operate. Let's all naively praise and foolishly dance around this person who speaks humbly of his intellectual arrogance! How gullible are we to grammar! 

The Golden Rule is like a geometric figure on an exam sheet; you know you'll never see it in real life. Hell, even the professors tell you, "Don't find the length of the sides by <em>just looking at it</em>. <em>Don't even guess!</em> You must use the equations we gave you." But do events in life present themselves so clearly, as if begging to be solved by an equation? Can you just <em>not look</em> at the beauty and stupidity of your loved ones and friends? This is the paradox of <em>morality </em>and <em>explicit statements and conditions lurching about in normative ethics.</em>]]></content:encoded>

There in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy. Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?" But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, He healed him and sent him away. Then He asked them, "If one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?"

		<title>Attributive-Referential Distinction qua Gettier</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Arguin' with a person on a forum.
<blockquote>Yes – this is in effect saying that the truth of (1a) entails the truth of (1b). What you call an existentially generalized proposition I call an ambiguous proposition.</blockquote>
You might call it this, but nevertheless, the proposition is true, justified, and could be believed by Smith or anyone he might pass that proposition (1b) to. Your argument that it is ambiguous is noteworthy, but it's about as noteworthy as regards JTB as statistics data with marginalization errors. 

Existential Introduction uses a particular to generalize. It is a valid form of reasoning by most modern logicians' standards. (Pa -> ExPx) 

This is the inference Smith makes. It is a logically valid inference. This is all Gettier wants you to look at, that of being logically valid. Thus, it becomes a Justified True Logical Inference. Gettier wants you to believe 
(a) that it is possible for Smith to believe it, 
(B) that if Smith were to believe it, it would be a kosher belief, and 
(c) that truth-functionality makes, in this case and in many cases of our lives, semantic content irrelevant (even though semantic content is there--this is your ambiguity argument). 

Ultimately, your "ambiguity argument" translates into our need to look at the semantic content of any proposition. However, upon analysis, there's no reason to see why a proposition cannot both (a) have semantic content and (b) have truth-functional parameters which condition its truth or falsity. 

Gettier wants us to look at (b), as I've said numerous times already, and ignore, for the moment, (a). I do not need to be told anymore the notion of "puns." I get the notion of ambiguity. I hope now that I have laid out (a) and (b), the argument will not be reiterated that the proposition (1b) is "ambiguous" or a "pun." That much has been understood for sometime now. 

What is not "ambiguous" is the jump from particular (Jones) to generalized (man). Your beef with ambiguity does not come from seeing that Smith made the inference. Your beef comes from the possibility of what Smith could have meant (semantic content, pun, etc). He, ultimately, had to have been something. Gettier would like you to look at only the truth-functionality of the situation; that is, 

(a) Smith believes "The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket" in strictly truth-functional terms with respect to the properties so stated (that of "man-ness," "getting the job," and "coin possession." 

We have trouble with this because we know and feel that Smith must have someone in mind. Keith Donellan's attributive-referential distinction gives us a clear view of the problem here. Gettier wants us to look at the proposition in the attributive sense. He wants us to see Smith has making a proposition in which some such man will be attributed with the properties of "getting the job" and "coin possession." 

Our problem is with the referential sense that Smith does not satisfy. Smith, with your (1b), could not be referring to any man. However, by Existential Instantiation, when people make propositions of the sort (1b), we expect them to have a referent in mind. 

So we can look at the proposition as attributive or as referential. <strong>What are the criteria for saying that we ought to look at it in one sense rather than the other?</strong> In short, Why should we even care about ambiguity (which pertains to reference) when Smith is talking about the attributive sense? And if your argument is "Gettier didn't mean that," then I am interpreting at the moment that he did. So, I'd like to understand how my interpretation is wrong. 

Now, Existential Instantiation/Elimination is trickier. (ExPx -> Pa) And it pertains to our problem of the attributive sense. We consider this a valid line of reasoning. Given the context of the situation, look at it this way: 

Smith is asked by the secretary, just on a whim of hers, "Who do you think will get the job?" Smith says, "The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket." For whatever reason, this secretary also knows that Jones has ten coins in his pocket, and, let us further suppose that she does have evidence of this property of coin possession that pertaining to Smith. She cheerfully smiles in response, and the office becomes silent. 

Now we are faced with the problem you guys raise; and this is the problem in its most proper sense. Between Smith and Jones, this secretary cannot use existential instantiation to infer the right man who bears ten coins and who will get the job. She has equal evidence for both; what is not conveyed to her is Smith's evidence for Jones getting the job; this information, which is vital, is not captured in the proposition. This is the nature of generalizations; we all know this. Most Asians become "math nerds"; most blacks become "basketball stars"; etc, etc. But it is quite different in this case: for the secretary, the proposition is not ambiguous insofar as the properties go. For her, she can only look at the properties of coin possession and getting the job. Being a man is by default true because they are both men. For her, she is tying "coin possession" and "job getting" together. 

Consider "men" as the universe of discourse. Now, being a man is just assumed. But we've gone to far, your arguments are with the meaning Smith had. I've already raised my argument: We must reconcile "truth-functionality" with "semantic content." You might say "Gettier ignores semantic content," but so what? You are ignoring truth-functionality. 

Are they mutually exclusive? 

You say "Gettier would love this to be the case..." Where is your justification for saying that Gettier is wrong about investigating these propositions only in terms of truth-functionality?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 There are compounds.
2 Compounds are aggregates of simples.
3 If there are aggregates of simples, then there are simples.
4 There being compounds presupposes that there are simples which constitute those compounds (hidden premise).
5 Therefore, there are simples.

How do we challenge the presupposition? In what ways do simples correspond to compounds? The argument is highly analogical; in fact, it can only be shown by analogy. If the contents of the analogy are themselves composed of simples, does not the mere use of analogy presuppose the truth of the argument for simples? In fact, the analogy commits itself to circularity. Can we separate the argument for simples from analogy (with respect to concrete objects)? Must we think in terms of ideas or concepts proper in order to establish the notion of simples? What does it mean for a "concept" to be composed of an aggregate of "simples" or simpler concepts? What would be the content of a concept? Does it have sense for us to say that a concept is "composed" of anything? That is, can we say that a concept has parts? What would qualify as a part of a concept? That to which it refers (i.e., its concrete objects)? To what does the notion of “compound” apply or refer? “Compound” is composed of letters (simples), but the word itself does not establish that there are letters, only that letters are used in a certain way. Outside of their word-context, their existence is not established. The assertion must be that the world itself is a compound of simples; however, in what sense does justification of the world equally justify its own parts insofar as their ontological status as compounded.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a meta-ethical theory, moral relativism is the broadest ethical line of thought which attacks the notion that concepts such as "good" and "bad" are deducible truths which bear some unified point in the logical form or physical structure of the world. That these concepts are truths at all, for the meta-ethicist, is determined by circumstances; the contexts in which these concepts arise are forceful and persuasive nowhere else except in the context in which they are used. Any use of a "good" concept outside of its original context is done so by analogical reasoning or weak relational argument. "Weak" in that, for the meta-ethicist, these concepts never correspond absolutely to any <em>other</em> concepts, presumably, outside of their original context.

As a normative theory, moral relativism usually holds that <em>tolerance</em> of moral norms is the best way to go about addressing moral disagreements, supposing that there are any true moral disagreements. A moral relativist would have you see the norms and their origins first before you address the moral proposition being given. In addressing the history of moral norms the moral relativist seeks to show that the norms, which presumably necessitate the moral position of any speaker, can be show to be harmonious with ostensibly contrary norms; in effect, no serious (or essential) moral disagreement arises. Norms of a culture, as the moral relativist wishes to show, can be harmonized; this pertains to presumably "extreme moral situations." For most other situations, and inevitably done arbitrarily so, the moral relativist must show that engrossing moral situations are not, in fact, "morally imbued. And thus, the situation is not, as will be typically argued, in need of "moral tolerance." For the normative moral relativist, it will be a serious matter of anthropological description rather than, as I am in custom of believing, ethical analysis.

Moral absolutism is an ontological argument for the existence of moral concepts being this way or that way within the moral sphere, supposing there is a moral sphere in which the concepts used correspond to the web of causal interaction. That is, what must be supposed is that our minds are epistemically capable of understanding the true value of those concepts used, rather than just some mere human (contrived) value. Moral absolutists of a humanist bent may be wont to assert that a human value <em>is </em>an essential value. The moral absolutist wishes to show that by the nature of the concepts used, what necessarily follows are ought-claims. It is a grand attempt at showing how an amalgamation of values, which presumably all people hold, can be jammed into one concept.

The normative moral absolutist will argue that singular concepts entail a finite number of other concepts not of the founding concept's exact nature. That is, "goodness entails happiness." "Goodness" is seen as an ontologically isolated notion which makes it possible for "happiness" to exist. Concepts similar to it, those such as justice and virtuousness, share the same fate in ontology of ethics. That is why so many philosophers of the past quibble furiously over how "goodness" can fit into a society. Alas, in sowing resolutely their distress, goodness thrives independent of "happiness"; in effect, "goodness" becomes a necessary condition for happiness, but, as my tone implies, is never sufficient. What's important to notice here is that I have been dealing with concepts themselves, free of context. The point is, a moral absolutist feels that, as said, moral reasoning can be done through ontological argument, the study of the "inherent" nature of the ideas being used. The notion of context is but a trivial one, seemingly undermined by the assertion that a particular form of "goodness" better explains the grand scheme of things.

A further assumption of the moral absolutist is that we are not semantically closed off from these concepts. That is, we have some relative or absolute understanding that these concepts are in themselves meaningful. So you can have a Semantically Relative Moral Absolutist, etc, etc.

The relativist wants to look at context first. What is typically argued is for a special status to be given to "context," given the presupposition that context dictates how we can even treat a moral problem at all. Further, epistemically, it is appealing to accept the governance of local contextual moral problems because our minds are finite. A moral relativist might argue that we cannot conceive the "essence of the Good" clearly and distinctly, as the Cartesians would say, any more than we can conceive God clearly and distinctly. Addressing the issue of God, regardless of cultural view on "God" (be it Brahmin, Buddha, Yahweh, etc), is important in that it helps one better understand how the absolutist preconceives certain concepts which she argues for. Further, and it is very often the case, the predisposition to moral absolutism follows from a religious background.

What's really at issue in this case, but this is just an immature theory, is that religious communities pass down a psychological conviction that brews a sort of myopia for its inhabitants. That myopia, as the relativist may argue initially along with me, is with respect to seeing the importance of local contexts as the leading determinant to making intelligible to the human mind those presumably true moral dilemmas.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[First let me just say how impressed I am with your writing style. Its improved a lot from what I first read a little over half a year ago. Now, on to business.

1) When you define moral relativism as the beleif that concepts such as good and bad must be looked at within context, I do not think that what you have defined is moral relativism. Moral relativism, as I understand it at least, is the belief that concepts such as good and bad ACTUALLY ARE good or bad and are contingent on a particular context (be it social, historical, cultural, individual, etc.) This is in contrast to what you originally defined, which deals more with sense rather than ontology. That said, I pretty much agree that terms such as good and bad can only make sense within a larger picture (in the context of the human condition; my two cents.)

2) Second paragraph: if the moral relativist is going to hold that tolorance is the best way to go in moral disagreements, he or she will be making a value claim (specifically, that tolorance is a better way to go about dealing with moral disagreements than, say, pursecution.) This raises the question of what it is he or she thinks the value of tolorance is relative too, and why it is he is being so intolorant of my desire to be intolorant. 

Your conclusion is a very shakey. Do you think that non-religious communities dont pass down psychological convictions? Are you under the impression that a commune of Athiests, for example, wouldnt pass down some basic values and virtues to their children (Rape is wrong!)? 

Citizens of Athens were religious in that they believed that the gods created the Universe, but because the gods of Greece were squabbling, fueding, and sometimes incompetent, prigs, the values of Athens were not connected very much to the Gods. Instead, values such as courage and kingliness formed as a response to necessary human functioning.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Any set of words that contains "God" as a lexical unit is senseless; there is nothing cognitively asserted except what is imagined by the speaker. Each speaker's imagination will be unique. Therefore, when a speaker (apologetic or antagonist, to any degree) utters a set of words which contains "God" as a lexical unit, nothing will be asserted except what is imagined by the speaker, and no speaker will imagine the same ideatum exactly. What must be address is this: Can speakers coherently express what is imagined <em>at all</em>? (Is "attending church" <em>coherence</em>? Is a social norm a manifestation of coherence?) Why can speakers utter propositions with <em>inconsistent</em> ideatums <em>at all</em>? (e.g. "My God is not your God"; etc.)

Asserting your stance of antagonism does not express what you are opposing, unless you suppose that everyone else knows exactly what it is you have for your ideatum.

<strong>Scholium 1</strong>

The "forgotten sculpture" refers to an ancient story of a sculptor who, as a young man, builds a magnificent marble statue. In his hurriedness and continued work, his sculpture becomes misplaced or dropped in a bush near his shop. Years later, the sculpture reveals itself to him at his feet as he's entering his shop. Now, he knows that he crafted the object, that it was the expertise of his hands which brought it into existence. However, what he has forgotten is his inspiration, his emotional drive and feelings at the time of chiseling the muscles and fabric of the toga. He has forgotten the meaning behind the statue. He must derive a new meaning from what he sees, what he possesses at the moment. However, what of the emphatic connection he had with it long ago?

This is what "God" is. It is a forgotten concept. And in seeing this, who are we to reject or deny any other person's statue? Who are we to even talk, as if it were important to us, about this man I have described and the emotional complexities he shares with his statue?

When we speak about God, we talk about another man's perfection. There is no "private God"; that said, we must understand how this word "God" and its meaning fits into our language. To reject it by an outward expression of disbelief does nothing to help or hurt this endeavor. Describing yourself as being "of God's people" does just the same. These activities of "defining oneself" do nothing fruitful, nothing worthy of comment.

But I suppose it is the absurdity of human suffering which compels us to act so naïvely, so immaturely.

		<title>Notes on Use and Coherence</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we consider whether a <em>something </em>such as God exists, what must first be ascertained, obviously, is what is meant by the word "God." This is the more general endeavor; but what is more specific is this: Can we count what is meant by "God" as a something that, in analyzing the referential presupposition, counts as a <em>thing</em> in the most basic and <em>ordinary</em> sense. By "basic" I consider that which is atomic to a system that is perceived; for instance, in a system of players on a football team, I might call the quarterback a basic unit of that team. Of course, what must further be checked is if my use of "team" is proper. In doing so, I have committed myself to a semantic treatment, an assertion that this collection (the "team") is intelligible and commonly accepted linguistically by any other language speaker of my learned and communal language. In reflecting on the semantic preoccupation of "God," would it be that we can perceive it in a most basic sense, as delineated by my analogy? Furthermore, to the nature of ordinariness, how might we consider this concept "God" as such? Can we obtain a standard by which "God," in being used within language, is judged without committing any error to that language? An error might very well, in this case, consist of breaking the boundaries presupposed by that language of intelligibility. Would it be that the use of "God," brings about an instance of communication breakdown--where language fails to capture the meaning of this term's employment. But most importantly comes the issue of reducibility of the concept itself. Specifically, I might suppose that when a language speaker utters "God" in some sentence A, that usage of "God" can only be understood because of its <em>proper use</em> and <em>coherence </em>within the totality of the language itself and within the constructed sentence itself. In being coherent within a sentence, the use of "God" must be understood by relation to some particular event or object. The entire sentence itself will possess a meaning, a sense, if the use of "God," in being related to some particular event or object, does <em>not </em>prevent the sentence A from having a use within the language in which that sentence inheres. The question now, then, is this: Does "God" exist in language wherewith no relation can be observed? To play hyperbolic: What would be meant by a language if she were to utter, strictly, "God!" without situational context. Naturally, one could imagine a person reacting to a terrible accident or signaling one's own frustration, but imagine that there is nothing to which one is responding. We are continually responding to events and objects, so clearly the use of "God" must be combined with something else in discourse, contrived (argumentative, philosophical, etc.) or accidental (expressive, explicative, etc.). That said, let us suppose that in one's use of "God," the sentence in which it inheres is understood <em>as </em>a gateway term or <em>through </em>some other gateway term, ignoring, for the moment, the use of either term (supposing further, for the sake of simplicity, we are dealing with two simple terms). For instance, let us address the notion of a "private God." That would be, at first glance, the notion that one's God in some sense can only be understood by that person. Presumably, that person's private experiences provide for that person a unique God which is barred off and inaccessible to other persons. The notion is better understood as one having a "personal relationship with Him." For the most part, what a person means by this is that in some way, God interacts with persons (for, presumably, persons are God's greatest creation), and furthermore, that God is interested and invested in each individual person's unique and individuated affairs. But let us inspect this: for this notion of a "private God" to make sense at all, what must be understood is at least the concept of privacy. The word "privacy" either acts as a gateway for "God" to have sense or is understood through "God." But in order for the word "private" to be understood, it must be interconnected with a lexicon, consisting of other words which themselves give "private" its sense. If we take "private" as the gateway term, "God" will only be understood once it is assimilated into the entirety of the language which gives "private" its sense. That language itself will consist of an infinite number of uses which correspond to the sentences in that language which, further, are composed of words with uses for the sentences in which they inhere.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Thoughts on Causation</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 "Cause" can refer to reconfiguration, in which a new thing emerges from preexisting things, or "cause" can refer to the production of a new thing from non-existing things. [EDIT] The term itself is inherently ambiguous. Its sense is only derived from analogy; the analogy itself presupposes objects (things) which are related in a certain and meaningful way and that the analogy itself can be an analogy for other things. Therefore, the "analogy," by use, presupposes its internal contents and presupposes that at least external another system for which it can be an analogy. "Cause" is understood in this way: that it is cognitively meaningful by reference to another system. The problem: in understanding "cause," you do not access the "origin" of any thing within the other system. That a new thing is perceived may be called "causation" or that the concepts "new" or "novel" is meaningful may be called cause. But in giving "causation" its meaning, a system that is related cannot give "causation" an origin. Imagine this: the creation of the 47th iPod in a factory. It is "new" and "novel" to the system of [the factory], [the store in which its sold], [the house in which it now resides], etc. However, the no one could have conceived its being created at the exact time in the exact way in which it was created. From this, we see that "causation" has much to do with "ignorance" and its relation to "perception." This notions combined give us a meaningful understanding of "causation."

2 A person has a belief or beliefs. And for that person, his or her beliefs will only entail certain propositions [for that person alone]. When you use "speculation as belief" in your argument, you are using it in an equivocal way. Speculation refers to [a single person's speculation].

3 People may speculate in concert, of course, but this does not guarantee any new thing as existing (for instance, a communally accepted true definition. For a communally agreed upon concept, it will always be a tentative one. But what is certain is that it is possible for a person to hold on to a concept solidly. For instance, I can say for certain that I will always belief that there is only one member of the null-class. But for a community qua community, this principle axiom of set-theory may shift to a mutated definition. But not for a community qua individuals. This point is important because when we say "belief" we mean a person's beliefs, not a communities beliefs or "the Form of Belief."

4 Many arguments will use "belief" as if it were a Platonic Form. This is poor philosophical grammar. Thus, the argument is not false or true, but meaningless. If you encounter an argument of this type, detached from humanity, you should move on to a better argument to attend to.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bound to the rigid necessity of another's web
Each of us will toggle, as if condemned to freedom,
A perspective, produced from the ebbing of naught,
Where troubled coffins loom without expiration

Exasperating will be the rigor of our chains, but
Compelling will be the harmony which they bear
Therein, as if from without, will our Landlord dream
Of the souls which selfishly confiscate emendation]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Outwardly what one sees is the closing of eyes and some tradition drenched gestures, but most disgustingly, in my view, it is the shutting of one's eyes, the overt rejection of the experiential, that perturbs my own spirit. The pretense of it is that one is jousting some manifest materialism, even the stark dogmas of naturalism, as awkward as that sounds. As if an act of prayer itself were an argument with a logic or philosophical school. One may commend herself for condemning the experiential; but what is the comparison to philosophy that I seek?

In barring a faculty of the senses, a secret is introduced to one's self. That secret is of the trajectories of experiences which one can only assume carry on outside of the self-induced event. The secret becomes what one keeps from herself. With eyes closed, the world becomes a secret of a serious whole. What is presumed is that virtue is contained in the activity of this secret one bears--therewith a burden is redeemed only if it is told, but a vice, as the pretense goes, necessarily corresponds.

But in condemning those objects, hidden away by subject-reclusivity, I see a likeness to that philosopher who, in most cases I say, travels on the road of concepts, devoid of attachment because of the principle of the endeavor. The venture of analysis seems to presume a correspondence with reality that brushes me as an article of faith one must take. The cognitions one perceives in taking those careful linguistic steps, in crafting cautiously, seems so remarkably like the shutting of one's eyes.

The philosopher in the right mood walks so dangerously close to flavors of piety. Often does this comparison consummate my own dejection.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dirty Version of a Critique on Modo-onto-arguments</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This will be a rant of the sort that seems trivial to most, in a way similar to the perception most have of philosophy. It's the idle man's game; as if the presupposition were discreet that any other discourse (most importantly theirs) actually does anything proper; that is, insofar as their "conscious axioms and premises" are concerned. And this will be their charge: you use jargon, whether conscious or not; speak my language! Let's see you drown in your messy literature; I see you suffocating as if that were an art form (fumble the translation into a common tongue).

Despite those (supposedly) <em>performative</em> trips, the hidden premise is not so couched as one might think; through the fault lines of language, your discourse harbors calamitous wounds. My prayer each day is that proponents as such never see them; the feeling I bear is similar to the one the atheist carries in "defending" the theist's psychological need. The lies reek of humanity, of humanism, as if the nature of man, supposing their is one, can defend legitimately the extensions of man's trivial intellectual aesthetic crisis. But we call it now "rational", now "emotional," as if we've made any real move from our "collective source."

We find ourselves in situations like the paragraph that precedes, ranting like mad fools through the day as if an engine of victorious wit. We rumble, roar, stomp and persuade from sources we think we thought we knew very well of and even the sentence has been given a "memory." Language has no memory; what it involves is use. But I traverse the lines and I find no signs of my knowledge on my part or yours. Is language poetic? Is it philosophical? 

One will say that it is a simple thing. The simplicity comes from the event of my saying it is so; where the contradiction presumably lies is therein what I say, rather than that I say it rather than that I not. So we stumble, so many think, and despite my shouts (to those naïve: as if I were shouting as a philosopher to philosophers, rather than as an indiscernible, an invalid, a part, like the rest), into what is called "necessity." Abhorrent lines of philosophical and poetic filth follow like vomit from this concept, as if "necessity" were not only a more emphatic way of breathing, heaving, and shouting--"necessity! necessity!" No; instead, it tells you a story, so they say, of something grand but natural. In those eyes, a "way" is projected. It is a cacophonous event (because I have to repeat it aloud to ensure myself of what has transpired) to witness <em>value</em> prescribed and then transcendentally so; weeping is my reaction to the continual equivocating moans of agents. Yet I have to defend myself as if I had a position. Of course, I know this is where rants usually end up. Necessity is a motherfucker.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[And how might I say "the beauty of ideas"
Relates to the idea of beauty,
If it in notion relates? If this notion relates,
It presupposes that it relates.
Which precedes, we ask? 

Dwindling into itself does the question,
and I careen past it again and again.

In asking, I have taken what of it that is there,
There determining; and I have said what it has
Determined, though sanctioned by that it has
Determined. Standing static to the idea

Of beauty are, presumably, those ideas which
I find beautiful. Does the beauty of ideas 
Give me the idea of beauty or is it my act
Of speaking through the beauty of ideas?

The act; the beauty; the idea; no idea acts, 
But neither do we see "beauty" acting; or 
Beauty acting; is "beauty" an act of itself?

Who finds therein the quote what is outside of it?
The subject entreats its own proclivity as subject;
Politely though seeming, but trampling in fact.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Why atheism today? &mdash; "The father" in God is thoroughly refuted; likewise "the judge", "the rewarder". Likewise his "free will": he does not hear &mdash; and if he heard he would still not know how to help. The worst thing is: he seems incapable of making himself clearly understood: is he himself vague about what he means? &mdash; These are what, in the course of many conversations, asking and listening, I found to be the causes of the decline of European theism; it seems to me that the <em>religious instinct</em> is indeed in vigorous growth &mdash; but that it rejects the <em>theistic answer</em> with profound mistrust.

It pains me when visions visceral
Pass over their propounding vainly--

We dash so suddenly by grades of
Left over but compassionate still--
Waver, waver in waves, tiny runes!

Why can you not see their drifting
Monolithic tumbling; concern, concern!
From permanence will the strings blow

Tussle beyond our parameters; glowing
Distantly from their own--in contempt
Of the errors that pressure our gaze!

Let us challenge the warmonger <em>synthesis</em>!
In our forever viewing of the sky
Will categories project no more, and
We will not say they do:

Will we not come out of sleep
Will we not end our journey
Will we not sojourn nonentity
But will we cajole <em>antithesis</em>

And the dreadful container of <em>thesis</em>
Will realize beloved are our chants,
Claims to joy, passion, and positive affects!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Symbolic<em> of?</em> To say science and religion can complement one another makes me ask<em> is science itself not just symbolic?</em> Do you wish to say that science does not concern itself with "truths"? Why write of the knowledge-claims of the Scripture as symbolic and the moral-claims as "complementary"? Are you suggesting that religion ought to "learn its place"? I get it: religion does not deal with "truth" while science does. But still: metaphors must be grounded in something or else you have destroyed what it means to be a metaphor.

Are you saying metaphors predicated on ignorance are possible? If so, why trust the scientific metaphors as "truth"? It's possible that they are ignorant metaphors. So you say: "religion is the old science; the new science unravels new truths." But aren't they just "better" truths?

Fine; the Bible lost out on its presumed geocentricism and other "physical" claims. But what of the social sciences? Are there claims in the Bible of cognitive, social, and psychological nature? This is where we get closer to the problem and your answers become more vague. Does the Bible "win" on psychological claims or does science? Stop dealing with the easy stuff like evolution and geocentricism. How about the implicit psychological claims of the Bible, if there are any?

Will you say: "the Bible only gives us a rough impetus in the right direction while science gives us a more fine-tuned answer"? Well, the Bible might be making a more far-reaching claim and science is just to blind to see it. What if science is like the philosopher?--only present to convolute the answer. Nevertheless, respect your theoretical origins!

Is this the nature of "complementing"? Science muddies the waters while Scripture tells us that it is water that we're filling with murk? If that is the case, science is doing, I think, anything but complementing.

But the stone stops here: Scripture makes a claim about creation which can be true or false. Catholics and Jews might say "well, our doctrines are much more esoteric than science can (or will allow itself to) apprehend." This is not a complement. This is a condescending stab. Science will not allow "god" into its postulates and definitely not into its definitions or axioms. So this "complementary" nature you speak of is absurd.

It's complementary to you because you are neither a scientist nor a theologian, so you do not see those embattled. It's easy for the layperson to say "well, it's all working out fine." Science is itself esoteric with its jargon and methodology. Are you formally introduced to either to begin saying, "well, they not only seem to be working out but actually are working out"?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I see now: "Microevolution proves macroevolution." 

<strong>Gloss: </strong>Look, if the latter is not provable, this means the former is not provable. This means that if you do not believe the latter is provable, you logically do not believe the former is provable (Microevolution). Do you really wish to logically say this? What does logic know anyway! It seems almost fruitless to learn logic when verbs like "to prove" and "to believe" have variable meaning across persons. All you can do is give counterexamples which they will happily ignore because they're not relegated to "student," such as in a classroom setting. Professors' and books' counterexamples are seen as "profound" and moving, etc while your street counterexample though bearing all the same properties is overlooked like a bum with a PHD.

xXx_Syllogizms_xXx:
A invents B.
B invents C.
Therefore, A invents C.

A entails B.
B entails C.
Therefore, A entails C.

Actually, I take it back. Logic can help people realise their shitty reasoning skills. However, the <em>important</em> stuff is left to predicate calculus. Students aren't learning the useful stuff, I suppose, until they are introduced to relational logic. Once here, you are, I believe, forced to see that certain predications simply cannot be made of certain entities. Thus, one will see that certain properties cannot be logically possessed by objects in one's ontology.  A entails B, B C; therefore, A C tells me that wherever I replace the free variables A,B and C, the object so replacing these variables must be something that coherently maps to my language. Mapping to language coherently is a necessary condition for an object, linguistic or otherwise, having possibly justified existence in one's ontology, any ontology.

To think that a subtheory, like Microevolution, is supposed to "prove" Macroevolution is a severe abuse of language. It's incoherent and only leaves one to question the speaker's understanding of what it means to prove something. Etc. Prove through evidence? The subtheories account for <em>different data</em>, talk about different stuffs. Prove through logic? Supposing they could, these theories are based on inductive principles: there are no (deductively) logical conditions for proof. We find ourselves back at "evidence" again--again, different ontologies, different ontological articles of evidence. The definitions are different, thus the "phenomena" are different in nature.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Questions to Fair Trade</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2008/10/31/questions-to-fair-trade/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At around mid-summer, Trey and I had chats about why we are dissatisfied with our being in United Students for Fair Trade. We had criticisms with two scopes: Movement scope, Campaign scope and concerning ideology (which just means philosophically-oriented criticisms). Movement scope just means with respect to the entire Fair Trade movement, and Campaign scope means with respect to the local USFT group on campus.

Criticisms concerning Movement scope primarily have to do with Starbucks and the agenda/methodology of TransFair. (In speaking about TransFair, I will be, of course, restricted to the domain of U.S. imports and certification. So, it is not necessary that these criticisms of TransFair extend to European affiliates and other foreign affiliates.) I've come across in the literature centered on Fair Trade that (1) Starbucks thinks it's pretty silly to entrust 30-40 people with all of their inspection needs. This argument was made by some higher up at Starbucks around 2007. TransFair is the FLO/US Fair Trade not-for-profit inspection affiliate. (But they do receive $0.10 per pound inspected.) In 2007 it operated with around 30 employees/personnel. Starbucks, as it has been argued, has a massive quantity of imports that drastically exceeds the inspection capability TransFair has to offer. Perhaps TransFair has significantly grown since 2007, but I doubt it. Nevertheless, this is a question to which I need an answer. I think everyone needs to obtain a sufficient answer to this question before they even put "Fair Trade" and "Starbucks" in the same propositions, positive or negative, about either entity because their capability insofar as their function will, in a serious way, be determined by the personnel/employees each organization maintains. It must be noted, too, that Starbucks has its own ethical trading/inspection group, CAFÉ, that attempts to, or actually does, serve the same purpose as TransFair. 

Now the reason why I bring this group up at all (I am obviously aware of the "Nike inspecting its own sweatshops" argument) is because in order for TransFair to accommodate Starbucks import quota, it would seem that Starbucks would have to <em>invest</em> a substantial amount of money into TransFair in order for TransFair to do the job that Starbucks would require, as per TransFair's certification process/criteria. As it stands, it seems that Starbucks would have to <em>buy</em> or assume a significant portion of TransFair in order for Starbucks to be served insofar as its importation needs. Starbucks' ethical group, CAFÉ, would just become TransFair. So it seems like the Nike-inspector argument is inevitable. But furthermore, what about TransFair's "100% Fair Trade" purchasers, who go the way of Fair Trade solely in virtue of their ethical commitments? And of their artificially reduced counter prices in the name of their commitments? (Be careful when you talk about whose not paying more per cup, customer, importer, roaster, small business, etc.) How would they feel about Starbucks owning major portions of <em>their</em> only means of acquiring Fair Trade beans? I raise more concerns on this latter topic later. Further, the argument can't be, "Well, it's just the right the to do. Starbucks' fat cats have bloated pocket books anyway." Which fat cats? Are you saying we should revolutionize our mystical free market system? ignore some of its tenets, like the one about liberty? All right, fine. If you'll down that argument, <em>why</em> are you in Fair Trade? Do you not realize that it is just a free market initiative? It is itself governed by the whims and philosophical tenets of the system which you claim is loaded with fat cats. You're not taking money away from the these gluttonous felines, you're giving them <em>new</em> markets to exploit, the "oh, look I have a Fair Trade sticker" market, the "ethical market," and the general, pervasive commodity fetishism that dominates our <em>pathos kapital!</em>

But is this an argument against the claim that (2) Starbucks should be doing <em>more</em> than purchase roughly 10% of their total coffee beans as Fair Trade certified? Well, this is an interesting argument because while on the face of it, it looks to be "economical" it might very well be taken as "moral." Does the proponent of such a claim mean that Starbucks should be taking strides to do something ideological because what is ideological cannot be in a serious sense detached from the "labor" or the producers of their coffee beans? That is, can we say on behalf of Starbucks, "Well, they <em>do</em> have a business model to maintain. Financial sustainability comes first." Well, we could go Marxist or Pathological Capitalist with this one. Nevertheless, no one will be sold by a straight <em>allegedly</em> "ideology" argument or a strict "economic" argument. Supposing there are clear distinctions here, as we usually do, either the side that wishes to "stick to their essential tenets" need to be convinced as to why their tenets are not so essential, or they need to be shown how their tenets cause an overall collapse of their system, economical or ethical. If Starbucks can be shown that their ignoring of "labor issues," to whatever degree that dissatisfies Fair Trade proponents, in a serious way undermines their economic agenda, then Starbucks must give way. The other move can be to show that Starbucks', or the Capitalist etc, tenets themselves are incoherent and flawed without an essential appeal to "labor issues." So you can go with a "labor issues are essential" argument, but in which case you must show how "economic issues" are inessential, or you can go with a "economic issues the way you do it fail" argument, thus the Capitalist has no reason to ignore "labor issues," because ultimately their system has imploded.

In any case, both sides need to respect the commitments of the other because there seems to be an implicit pragmatic maxim that if you you ain't talkin' my language, then you are just wasting my time. I'm not saying any side needs to give up their guns. But they need to understand that the other side has guns that they feel are shiny and clever. Don't just bark with your guns on safety.

The other Movement scope criticism centers on the potential charge of cultural imperialism. This was a favored argument of Trey. I stumbled onto myself, but by way of "market competition." My initial discovery was first (3) Fair Trade pits non-Fair Trade farmers against Fair Trade farmers within a geographic region against each other. What this means is that non-Fair Trade farmers may have a quality product that is superior to the product that is usually determined by the Fair Trade certification process. But this means the non-Fair Trade farmer likely gets paid a variable rate depending on the success of the Fair Trade exports (sales). This is not necessarily a bad thing, as this is the way markets work. However, this seems to be in conflict with the ideological agenda of Movement scope. (4) Exactly which farmers is Fair Trade set out to provide with sustainability? Are non-Fair Trade farmers being economically undermined and alienated for reasons that have nothing to do with Fair Trade certification <em>actually</em> providing a comparatively better product? (5) The bigger charge is cultural imperialism. This is a very difficult argument to make clear, but it is a much easier argument to just make. One claim has been that certain farmers have their own traditional growing methods, and Fair Trade <em>might</em> undermine those methods, should those traditional methods (likely highly dependent on geographic restrictions--this is an important point) be inconsistent and incompatible with the Fair Trade certification. I have not come across any actual cases of this, but it has been brought up in the literature. I'll be on the look out for "evidence," whatever that means.

Trey's argument is not this one, and I have not really fleshed out the complete form of my own. Trey's argument is largely one that any "liberal-minded" Westerner will <em>just get</em>. The West, they say, has an imperialistic mentality--specifically the U.S.. This means the U.S. can be charged with nigh-innumerable counts of imperialism by means of force, economic alienation, cultural infiltration, and various means of general exploitation. All this is usually tied, as they say, to some variant of Capitalism, given the timeframe. Never does the liberal address the more deep-seated question of this bogus ideological commitment we have to the incoherent notion of "liberty," "property," and "individualism." It's just by-passed these notions and only the more perceptible enemy is attacked, such as the Pathological Capitalist or the C.E.O. or Market Monkey, etc. But that's not my concern now, though Trey did very much, and I could tell, wish to address these more deep-seated (and likely incoherent wherever they appear in propositions) notions. In any case, back to my point that to most liberal-minded folk, the charge that the West will likely culturally influence these impoverished countries does not take much argument. I suppose if it is seriously necessary that one need an "example" of this picture playing out, one does not need to be involved in this kind of debate in the first place. Not that they do not have an adequate understanding of history, but it is more so that accepting this kind of argument requires that one, in an unbiased way, at least accepts for sake of discussion the interpretation of the liberal. One might simply not be able to "think in that line of thought" which in a way just means whoever utters such nonsense just doesn't <em>want</em> to engage in dialogue. They'd rather just regurgitate their script and, I guess in some tacit manner, hope their jargon enters their (potential) opponent's "nonconscious interpreter."

The charge is that the West, by means of Fair Trade, will eventually expand so much so that, by some unsurprising, but likely irritating, chain of events, Starbucks will appear in the most now-destitute regions of Ethiopia or Chad or wherever coffee and similar commodities (as commodities) are grown. I'm being hyperbolic here, but I should hope the point is achieved. It is in the nature of things to assert their power, by whatever means, so goes the assumption, and this fact shows itself in the history books. Eventually, those "humble" and "noble" farmers who were once respectable and austere, for doing nothing more than sustaining themselves, like we all must do, will become Smith, your new Nigerian World-Unionican stockbroker buddy and wing-man who drinks the Starbucks he brewed and produced the beans for in his leisure time. Whether something absurd like this holds or not isn't really the question, it's more so the idea of assimilation of culture. Since we're going for this queer concept of solidarity, it seems that it comes at the cost of homogeneity (of culture, identity, etc). But this latter argument is more "philosophical," which I suppose in a strange way means something like "imminent." Perhaps what Trey, myself, and any others who have observed the arguments we have observed, will likely be more concerned with the "immediate ethical" claims which are espoused from the Movement proponents. Perhaps we should not let our "imminent" feelings undermine the Movement's agenda. But moral language is a seemingly universally applicable thing (which means it seems to be in contradiction to our "imminent conclusions") if not as logical but by the simple fact that it feels like moral language attempts to say more, in principle, than it can actually substantiate.

I read some economist (perhaps just an economic journalist) who makes this similar argument, that of Fair Trade being charged with cultural imperialism and undermining traditional growing methods. The "economic alienation" argument is more so my own that I worked out. The Western imperialism argument is from Trey. I take them to be criticisms that each deserve a response, and not a gesture of unimportance, for each criticism attenuates, I think, many of the "general moral claims" expressed by the Fair Trade proponent. If the Fair Trade proponent means something more like "look over there, fix that," then perhaps they have more of a leg to stand on. But here we are again, in need of a serious discussion of economics, concepts like "the long-run," and the repeated charge that Fair Trade is too weak of a solution because it is "market-based." That is, does Free Trade even work given dissimilar (and incompatible) governments and the errors existing between disparate "markets," some being free, others being not-so-free.

Another point is that (6) 100% Fair Traders in the West, specifically, have become dissatisfied with how they are misrepresented on TransFair pie charts. I haven't really made the problem clear for myself, but it generally seems to be that 100% Fair Traders' "ideological commitment" to purchasing 100% Fair Trade coffee beans is not being accounted for by TransFair when fat-companies like Starbucks and Sam's Choice are thrown into the mix. It seems like, these devout Traders say, they're not being represented because they are small, whereas Starbucks et al will skew the percentages which indicate representation because they are big. I think the real issue is <em>How do you "represent" ethical commitment at all on a graph?</em> Maybe I an completely misunderstanding the issue, but this argument can be found in "The Pros and Cons of Fair Trade." On the face of it, it just seems like TransFair is hurting its ideological buddies because of the nature of its economic commitments overall.

I suppose this covers, for the time being, the issues I (and Trey) had concerning the ideological and the Movement scope. Now I pass onto the USFT campaign at UH.

Perhaps the largest influence acting on my own decision to leave the group had to do with taking Epistemology and being tossed into bouts of skepticism and nihilism. Specifically, issues with theory, evidence, and interpretation. Trey and I equally share a disdain for "metanarratives" and "myths." But what is much more alarming was the tendency toward incorrigible myths. Of course, with any "campaign," as such, it must have propaganda devices to keep its proponents inspired, but their must be a close relationship between that propaganda, or propensity to construe myth-like rationalizations, and the evidence to which that camapign's constituents have accessibility. Perhaps Trey and I were overwhelmed with the tendency or we simply failed to ask questions.

My primary worry was that of being misunderstood. I felt often misunderstood, so I felt I could not but be slowly ousted if only for incompatibility between myself and the campaign. For example, it made no sense to me to agree with the conclusion that "the local campaign stopped a Starbucks," given I had the evidence of financial services claim that (a) Starbucks shut down 600 locations (and all the press I read then related to the closing of those 600 locations) and that (b) the SGA made an error, mistake, or whatever you wish to call it. Because it is an unforgivable mistake, perhaps, does not justify the legislation passed. It just means "mistake," regardless of one's opinion of it. Third, (c) the SGA and financial services claim library officials <em>like</em> their Lounge the way it is (at least for a little while, I suppose). Fourth, the Chartwells press release is irrelevant. I failed to see a necessary link between Chartwells' planning and Aramark's planning (especially given that the Chartwells' press release come off like a <em>suggestion</em> and was nonetheless 4 years old. Fifth, so of course, the most substantial evidence, the "fact" that the library official Dana Rooks was not aware of a "final decision" made about the library Starbucks or the Fair Trade kiosk. I wasn't there for the chat with her, but I have a feeling her immediate response was to a more general question, "Yeah, we haven't decided on that," not "Yeah, we're aware of the SGA Fair Trade resolution, but we're still contemplating Starbucks." I don't think "no final decision" means "Starbucks is a viable option as opposed to Fair Trade". I think it just means, as far as she was concern, "Oh, you guys passed a bill? Interesting. Well, we haven't made a final decision yet. I'm not really in a position to legitimize the governmental processes, as I myself only attend meetings and make my own personal suggestions," etc. A lot of this story appears incoherent at best, and it is definitely not a story bearing the capacity to substantiate claims that the campaign on campus has denied Starbucks' viral growth.

As it should be known, I am the Webmaster of the UH Students for Fair Trade website, but I am becoming worried about the allegations being made and the events which have occurred that make for them. 

For instance, "They [the editor-in-chief and opinion editor] claim there is a DC policy stating that they are not allowed to print editorials critical of the Daily Cougar!!!  Sounds like something out of a dictatorship doesn’t it? Not from a country built on FREE SPEECH."

Now, on the face of it, what is quoted seems to not accurately and completely account for the contents of the discussion which occurred between the persons involved. What this tells me, or perhaps a person less likely to even be aware of or in the capacity to understand the rules and tradition which govern the goings-on of the paper, that the Daily Cougar is not allowed to print <em>stuff</em> critical of the paper. Sure, it reads "editorials," but it does not account for the fact that the paper will run (print) <em>letters to the editor</em> or <em>letters to the paper</em> which are critical of the paper. The editor-in-chief gave the justification that it is tradition that papers follow this formula. The logic behind the paper is manifest by the tradition. But let's get one thing clear: editorials are written by staff writers, section editors, the chief--paid personnel. Writers of editorials are paid. We could play a funny linguistic trick, as I thought would hold, and say that the Fair Trade group wishes to be paid for an article critical of that medium, the Daily Cougar, that printed the article. In a word, the Daily Cougar would be paying for something which would criticize the Daily Cougar. Would you pay for someone to fail your exam? slash your tires? I'm sure this holds for <em>any</em> company: why pay the Fair Trade group to be critical of the Daily Cougar when the people who actually work for the Daily Cougar could be critical of the Daily Cougar? I'm sure they'd do a much better job, given that they work there and actually have to churn the puppy out. Potentially every systematic wrong turn during production could end up in an article. Luckily, "editorial" cannot be what the Fair Trade group meant. Perhaps, in theory, we are our own worst critics, is what I'm getting at. 

So they mean "guest commentary," something for which they would not be paid. All the same, however, the Daily Cougar <em>provides</em> the guest commentary as a free service to students willing to write. So the Fair Trade group would be biting the hand that feeds, which, even if their criticisms are accurate, would nevertheless, as appearances are important to campaigns, expose a seriously bad form. It's just plain stupid--for both the Daily Cougar and for the Fair Trade group. So run it as a Letter to the Editor. What does this mean? Well, it means the length of the piece will be cut in half. I am sure what can be said that is critical of the Daily Cougar could be truncated significantly, but maybe I am wrong. My understanding of the content that would appear in such an article would be something along the lines of, "The Daily Cougar likely accepts bribes" and "The Daily Cougar is in the pockets of the University Officials, despite, as they claim, that the Daily Cougar is not funded for by the University." I'm sure 300 words could cover that much without too much detail. But I guess evidence would have to be given as to why the Daily Cougar simply can't disagree, supposing that it does disagree with the group with respect to some important issue, for the same reason the Fair Trade group's other opponents disagree. So the University and the Daily Cougar both think the Fair Trade group is a bit too much. That does not entail that the Daily Cougar and the University have "joined forces." It doesn't seem that far-fetched that the Fair Trade group would have very few friends, considering that the group is more so out to convince others of their faulty assumptions or immoral and blind tendencies, rather than make friends. 

Not that I'm passing judgment, but these are the charges that I recall. And I don't need "friends" or "allies" if they're fundamental wrong, and they do in fact need to be informed of just how wrong they are when they are in fact wrong. But are they wrong? Further, are they <em>in fact</em> wrong?

But back to the claim of tradition. I think tradition is an important concern that must be respect, at least in the sense of the newspaper. Because in this case, "tradition" is a concept that takes on a very peculiar form. It doesn't mean something like, "This is the way we've always done it." Sure, the person making the tradition-claim might <em>seem</em> to come off as if he or she is doing this, but I think it has more to do with the logical consequences that "tradition" has. Arguably so, many of us philosophers take it without argument, and thus as tradition, that "existence is not a predicate" (at least the way "we" thought it was 100 years ago). Sure it's tradition, and we might only hold that belief because of a causal-tradition link. But that does not preclude the fact that in some real sense existence just ain't a predicate (or at least there are serious arguments against such a now-bold claim). We might not be aware of these arguments when we appeal to tradition, of course. It does raise the question, I suppose, of the burden of proof. If you claim something like "tradition says we do the paper this way," you can likely be asked to justify such a claim. Of course, with the Fair Trade group, they're more concerned with the "guideline" or "document" which further justifies the logical make-up of the paper...as if having a "signed document" will illuminate why the paper runs the way it runs. Perhaps the document is 10 years old? Perhaps it has no features that elucidate the structure? You might fight an empty document that says, "Hey, Daily Cougar, do X." What will the Fair Trade group say then? They certainly won't be happy, and they might try to amend the mandate. Perhaps a pause to reflect on the nature of how newspapers run will be illuminating, or perhaps asking sincere and exploratory questions of the editor-in-chief will be helpful. Not that I think it will, since I think it makes sense, as I have already argued for, that the paper should not run guest commentaries critical of itself.

(Sources will be provided when I find the motivation to look them up. I will be grammatically and stylistically repairing this garbage over time.)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Counterargument to anti-fair trade argument, 1</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["A number of criticisms have been leveled against the fair trade system. One criticism, most notably expressed in the December, 2006 issue of the Economist, is that fair trade will fail to achieve its objective because it ignores basic free market principles regarding supply and price. The argument runs as follows. By artificially establishing a minimum price for coffee, fair trade will cause producers to grow more of it to take advantage of the higher price. However, this increased supply of coffee will cause the price on the traditional market to fall, thereby creating a worse situation for farmers who are not participating in fair trade. If the problem with the traditional market is that prices are too low, then the appropriate response is not to create a price support, but rather, to allow market forces to run their course, meaning that coffee growers who are unable to make a living under current conditions should diversify and grow other crops or seek other options for their livelihood."
--A summary provided by <a href="http://ourworldcommunity.ning.com/profiles/blogs/2005022:BlogPost:4756">http://ourworldcommunity.ning.com/profiles/blogs/2005022:BlogPost:4756</a>

First, I do not think this argument can appeal to a claim non-Fair Trade will want to participate in Fair Trade production. It seems we'll have to just assume there are non-Fair Trade farmers who are unable to participate. The question is: How are they affected? In what ways can Fair Trade acquire them <em>as a category</em> or as various categories. What measures and restrictions can we modify in order to bring in these non-participating farmers? Since they are not included in the "target" of Fair Trade, why they are not a target seems to be an crucial property of this category of farmer. (See the smallholder rule; what are the reasons behind it?) Typically the answer why this crucial property exists is for the fact that the larger number of those helped seems to indicate a "better" state of affairs. I don't think this has anything to do with ethics or morals. My earliest pro-Fair Trade argument seemed to work within the mentality of the free market proponent: do not alienate your labor (even if your market is gross in supply). It seems quite easy to say "just switch markets, everything will work out if you just switch markets."  Problem is: this presumes that the producer (in the general, demographic sense) has this option. It assumes, further, that in certain geographic contexts, coffee producers have thriving alternative markets. My second counterargument is that this assumes (and perhaps my understanding of how planning for futures markets works) that producers (in that general sense, again) will be (1) willing and (2) able to switch back to coffee at the whim of the foreign market demand. Perhaps my understanding of the scope and flexibility of these producers is a bit too naive.

I think it is a bold claim to make that producers will oversupply what is available on such a primitive bit of motivation as "higher prices." This seems to not take into account that Fair Trade farmers will have more access to market information (perhaps I presume too much?). So they would then be able to make more economical and prudent decision about just how much to produce. In effect, they are given the option to produce at a rate which satisfies them while not being artificially forced to switch markets because of the volatility of the traditional coffee market. 

The article author (the person summarizing this clearly bad argument from the Economist) also makes a distinction I realized around summer. Sure, at the counter, Fair Trade coffee and non-Fair Trade coffee are at first presented with the mask of "specialty coffee." So the consumer usually has to choose (if they're in a place like Starbucks) between their favorite "specialty coffee" or Fair Trade coffee (which could be the specialty coffee, but just isn't--because it's Starbucks). This gives the impression that "Fair Trade" means "specialty." For example, one might think that "Fair Trade" is in opposition to "Caramel Macciatto," etc. This isn't the case.

I am using this example to highly my (late) discovery that mimicks this mix up. The same sort of thing occurs at the level of market supply. If more Fair Trade beans are put into the supply, a "specialty market supply" will be increased, not a "general green coffee beans supply. Sure, those beans can go into a Caramel Macciatto, but if that is the case, the Caramel Macciatto would be selecting beans from an entirely different supply than the traditional coffee supply. Fair Trade beans and traditional coffee market beans are not in the same supply. So when consumers purchase more Fair Trade coffee, they are only saying, "We want fair trade coffee!" not "We want more fair trade coffee beans and not any of those traditional beans." But it seems very easy to associate "Fair Trade supply" with "traditional coffee supply" and think that one is stealing from the other. This might not be the case.

"The free trade advocate might respond that as consumers switch to fair trade coffee, the demand for traditional coffee will decline, and this will cause a decrease in the price for traditional coffee. However, as demand increases for fair trade, more farmers will see the value in fair trade, seek certification, and convert from traditional coffee production to fair trade production, thereby decreasing the supply of traditional coffee as the supply of fair trade increases. As demand for traditional coffee drops (creating pressure toward a price decrease), so should supply (creating countervailing pressure toward a price increase). The liklihood of this scenario is indicated by the fact that currently, coffee farmers in the traditional market are lined up and waiting for fair trade certification. In order to obtain certification, cooperatives must demonstrate that there is a market for their product, so the supply of fair trade producers can expand only as fast as consumer demand for fair trade."
--Ibid.

I suppose this <em>factual</em> claim satisfies me, that non-Fair Trade farmers are "lined up" to get their own certification. This makes that <em>link</em> between the two markets. However, I still worry about the claim that "farmers will see the value in Fair Trade." I can imagine it occurring, through word of mouth. One farmer passes on to another how their revenue has increased. However, this does not address my question of the smallholder rule and individual non-Fair Trade farmers. I suppose the popullation of this category is negligible to barren.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[*waves one hand* Take a look at this claim (proposition):

(a) "Perception is reality."

Obviously this does not mean perception is a physical entity or has being in anything but a conceptual sense (homage to the linguistic turn, etc). It means some more along the lines of,

(b) If X perceives Y, then X does believe Y is real (or a fact).

And, (b) is logically equivalent to the following:

(c) If X does not believe Y is real (or a fact), then X does not perceive Y.

Perceiving and believing, of course, are human mentalistic properties, so they must apply only to human beings. (Do animals have "beliefs" like we do? Do they "perceive" in any approximately intelligible sense related to human perceiving?)

(b1) If X perceives that Bob is stealing from him, then X believes that Bob is stealing from him.

(c1) If X does not believe that Bob is stealing from him, then X doesn't perceive that Bob is stealing from him.

(c1) is clearly counterintuitive because this allows for us to say that our (negative) beliefs determine what we perceive. But if Bob is in fact stealing from X, X will never perceive it until he believes (first) that it is <em>actually</em> happening! (At the linguistic level, this is what is literally being said. Should we accept the linguistic interpretation or the idiomatic interpretation?) We're left thinking that new evidence does not in fact change our beliefs! But how do negative beliefs transform into positive beliefs about the same object? Clearly reality cannot be defined in terms of perception alone (supposing we take the literal interpretation). So it seems like we have nowhere else to look but to intersubjective criteria for what constitutes "reality," as we each have our own perceptions, or we must say that reality is grounded in some fact of the matter. This is what we usually do anyway. Either we seek that criteria and its corresponding data with others, or we "determine it" as objective <em>on our own.</em> (Dubious at best, I think.) So it seems like the idiomatic expression only prevails if one is unwilling or unable, perhaps, to obtain a verification method for the literal.

(Perception is not reality. ^ Reality is not perception.)

Therefore, the claim that "perception is reality" is a false claim (if taken literally), and it would be a false premise should it appear implicitly or explicitly in any argument.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Idea: How to Say Things With Actions</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2008/11/05/idea-how-to-say-things-with-actions/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This idea seems trivial in that it must have been considered before--in that it is a surprise to me that no one has written about it (perhaps I am wrong?)--, but it seems important in that the distinction between word and action is an unjustified bias. A bias that, more specifically, has captured the interest of analytic philosophers, if not all philosophers, insofar as their relentless attentiveness to the proposition, the statement as these things manifest in the sentence, the description, the lexical item of whatever flavor or arrangement.

But we can certainly see a proposition expressed in one's choosing to keep silent at this moment or that context, albeit a very indeterminate and vague proposition. But is this fuzzy quality of a proposition so expressed through (social) action that much murkier and opaque in nature than the one expressed by "There is a book over there"? The demarcations and "properties," I might argue, are equally blurry in both cases. I might verbalize on them equally with as much detail about lacking transparency in a strict semantic sense, I think, and not just a pragmatic. So the question is: Is the previous case, of intentionally keeping silent, capable of being described as involving a "semantic reference" as opposed to just "speaker reference"? Perhaps this question is too obscure and technical; perhaps I shall ask a more direct one, a simpler one: Do acts bear semantic properties at all? Does my <em>gesture-that</em> have a referent? Well, it seems this answer is obvious! It's in the demonstration of <em>that</em>. But not so clear: My sigh of impatience. Is it my slacking group member? Or is it my group in general? Might my force or timing of such a sign indicate which is my referent? Of course, I can ask more generally, does the <em>act</em> have a referent? Does action express a proposition, supposing that it does at all, under a Russellian framework of description? How would Russell or a descriptivist deal with proproposition qua action? Does action involve any meaning or semantic properties? 

It might seem easy to dismiss that actions can "express" descriptions of any sort, if one is to accept that I am using "express" and "description" in anything but a peculiar sense, a very <em>high</em> sense of the terms. But again, timing (and perhaps conditionality): Do actions follow a sort of logical behavior of the anaphoric pronoun? Does it "pick up" in a context its referent and refer/describe henceforth, thus expounding upon what was said of the established conversational object (referent)?

Are actions like propositional attitude reports, or do they have a logical function that is more objective and rigid (co-extensive)?--Say I am given a certain imperative, with perhaps a certain range of time by which I am expected to satisfy it. Have I thereby expressed something significant in my ignoring it or perhaps completing it in a certain and <em>idiosyncratic</em> way unexpected by the maker of that imperative? Perhaps, on the contrary, gestures, actions, or whatever the hell I have in mind are essentially intensional? Perhaps they fall nowhere in this divide.

Suppose I realize that my manner in satisfying it would be unexpected by the maker? Suppose that in preparing for a birthday party, simply by purchasing more than one was expected to purchase for decorations, this agent intentionally implicates that X. X can be whatever story you like. Another example is in communal gift sharing or perhaps "Secret Santa" events where one might express not only about herself in purchasing a certain gift but further something about the entire event ("ordeal"). Is it a major concern that any perceiving agent will likely grasp a wildly dissimilar proposition than some other speaker? Do two speakers interpret or understand "The man with the martini" just the same? I am trying to get at the presumptuous, supposing there is one, that the proposition qua sentence is something that is more readily available for investigation than the act. What of stares? Glares? Smiles at certain moments? Are these implicatures only in "conversations"? But what exactly is a "conversational context"? Might we find implicature outside of the bounds of this region? Does "conversation" mean talk exchanges only?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"But we can certainly see a proposition expressed in one’s choosing to keep silent at this moment or that context, albeit a very indeterminate and vague proposition."</blockquote>

Suppose that speaker A utters something which is clearly an opinion of some sort. Hearer B and A are amongst a few of their friends. No speaker or hearer is in direct conversation with the other. B keeps silent because B clearly wishes to maintain the secrecy of his opposing opinion about the same subject. Can we derive a meaning from this? Because what is not uttered, must we conclude that no proposition at all exists? What of a gradation of the proposition? Will there be a mediating proposition such that in being visibly unforthcoming in conversation, i.e. keeping silent, one expresses not what is meant to be withheld (the surpressed proposition), the speaker expresses something along the lines of "I wish to not divulge my opinion, or whatever, about that subject." Certainly this is not literally said, for the speaker has only made a few gestures. It is only a linguistic approximation of the action. It is a mapping of the social phenomena into a sphere of predictability. Who pries such a proposition from the experience? Is it the speaker who sees this, wishing for an opinion to be given? It may seem as though the speaker "sees" this statement before her mind. But surely this is not the case: actions are not linguistic entities. However, what will we say if, as far as we can tell, the speaker responds <em>as if</em> such a proposition were presented before her mind? Do we penetrate the chain of events--only to suffer a faulty theory? Ontology of action--the scientific ontology--and ontology of intention. Are they connected by the event? May we coherently discuss the "causal chain qua science" at all when the intention is present? Does the linguistic maneuver entail intention <em>at all</em> (modally necessary?)? What of when I utter a proposition but quickly realize I was hit by some sporadic psychic episode? I inquire as to that "axiom of conversation" which says "conversation (or discourse) is that event in which intention is manifest." I am not so certain of this. I can see that my attempts here look as though fumbling; but I am aware of the "dualism" of inten<strong>s</strong>ion and extension: my enemy is that dichotomy. Can we see intention where "formally" it cannot arise? Why would we (I) wish to?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>What, in fact, is "equality"? The term has been much invoked but little analyzed. A and B are "equal" if they are identical to each other with respect to a given attribute. Thus, if Smith and Jones are both exactly six feet in height, then they may be said to be "equal" in height. If two sticks are identical in length, then their lengths are "equal," etc. There is one and only one way, then, in which any two people can really be "equal" in the fullest sense: they must be identical in all of their attributes. This means, of course, that equality of all men — the egalitarian ideal — can only be achieved if all men are precisely uniform, precisely identical with respect to all of their attributes. The egalitarian world would necessarily be a world of horror fiction — a world of faceless and identical creatures, devoid of all individuality, variety, or special creativity.
--Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature by Murray N. Rothbard; <a href="http://mises.org/story/3071">http://mises.org/story/3071</a></blockquote>

But we say "the means of obtaining equality is the essence of the distinction." Thus, one means for obtaining equality is better or more warranting of approval than another. And we get bogged down into a discussion of these "means" and "measures" of obtaining our object. Is the implicit assumption that "equality is impossible, so your worries are not of concern to us"? Interesting that one should seek what one believes one cannot really obtain. Does one mean equality of "class"? Who determines the "class" which we, each of us, falls under?

So we seek "equity." But what is the relation between these two concepts? Is it a relation between signs (something manifest--where we say, ah yes, this is the end for which we each fought) or is it a relation between objects (the material conditions of our labor)? What counts as target for our goal of attenuating the ailments wrought by our "System"? What does "The System" corrupt? We will run with your theoretical object (this "System") until we drill our ourselves and our children into the dirt.

We will be alike in kind to a person who sees many faces of the world, almost every glimmering, bright, dusted, cracked, enamoring eye. But we will demand<em>, And now show me the world.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Simon sees a man save a woman from a river. Thus, Simon existentially infers:

1. X performed a morally virtuous (good) act.

The next day, Simon sees a man shoot a woman outside a convenience store. Thus, Simon existentially infers:

2. X performed a morally reprehensible (evil) act.

We can ascribe an attitude to Simon such that Simon believes 1 and 2:

3. Simon believes 1.
4. Simon believes 2.

Since you see where I'm going with this, I'll shorten this up: Suppose X is the same person in both cases.

Now we <em>can</em> say 5:

5. Simon believes X is morally good. [from 1]

And:

6. Simon believes X is morally evil. [from 2]

X now has two properties: that X bears the properties "is believed to be morally evil" and "is believed to be morally good." Problem for quantification it seems! Perhaps...

But can we get from actions to predications of moral properties? 

So we say 5 and 6 should be:

7. Simon believes X performed a morally good act.

8. Simon believes X performed a morally evil act.

Do we get the same problem of quantifying into the belief context? Seems like we get around it since performing an act which may fall under one description does not necessitate that one performs an act of any description whatsoever.

---
What I'm attacking here, though it may not be apparent, is the notion of persons bearing as properties "virtues" in any "lasting sense." Why do we need a "virtue ethics of actions"? It seems to only label the problem (as does "labeling a certain kind of character with virtues") rather than resolve it.

You have weaved for me a quilt of interconnected terms. It is claimed that I must accept the whole of them. Some patterns rigidly put at the other end of others, as if lawful and ordered.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["To put it very simply, he is our first African American president, or he will be, and we wish him well. But his choice, basically, is whether he's going to be Uncle Sam for the people of this country, or Uncle Tom for the giant corporations,” professes Ralph Nader on KTRH Houston.

So let's talk about "race matters" as if race matters. Likely I’ll clear something up about this presumed low point in American history — or you’ll rashly pluck out a term rather than acknowledge the whole in which it is but a part, become overheated, and wonder why post-racial America is getting strangled and hamstrung by such “racist resurgences,” as if we’ve “made it.”

Nader’s Dilemma invokes the background against which our president-elect will find himself: 40 percent of black American children age 5 and younger reside at or beneath the poverty line; school segregation of Hispanic and black youth is endemic; in the last 8 years disparity of wealth, income and education has increased; roughly 20 percent of black Americans are without health insurance coverage, 34 percent for Hispanics while 10 percent for whites; the unemployment rate is twice that for blacks in comparison to whites; on that very Nov. 4, Proposition 8, a measure that legally “protects” the sanctity of marriage from same-sex couples, was approved.

Judging from this background, Nader’s point is decisive and poignant: The lower classes and minorities are expecting something – a radiant liberator in the belly of this crushing institution. If you think we have achieved something alone in putting an African American in Office, then you must agree with Nader’s point, all the racial baggage therewith. You’re on the lookout for an Uncle Tom. We are indebted to Nader for this ammunition, for this historical underpinning perspective, the real hope that manifests in virtue of our awareness and scrutiny.

The popular doctrine demonstrates theatrically resentful behavior to any notion of race being relevant to our pageant politicks. Shepherd Smith of FOX News, in interview with Nader, captures this hypersensitivity with his primed pseudoretort, “(dramatic pause) Really?” When asked to recant his statement, Nader impressively poised responded, “(raises eyebrow) Not at all.” In that act we see a high point for democracy, a beacon of social dissent. And why would he retract? What “in hindsight,” so Smith supposes, is there to speak of? an inconsequential “tsk tsk”? If these are the only responses you can give, or something similarly unsubstantial, unargumentative and dimwitted, you probably should not have voted.

If you voted for Obama because of a warm feeling or because you believe you share an “identity,” you might as well have voted for him because he’s African American. Can you coherently and clearly divide Obama up into “ethnic” and “presidential” portions, to say you voted for a faceless hero?

Now, Nader did not in fact call our president-elect an Uncle Tom. The condition is that if our president-elect does not support the downtrodden and those with bleeding wallets, he will be an Uncle Tom.

If you believe Nader revived unduly any racial connotations, here’s my reply. Either we can look at our president-elect as having no “character,” no face (someone you cannot identify with), in which case he owes no allegiance to any class (which I think just primes him for assimilation into the only non-human “class” in this country corporate “persons”), or we can view him as an ethnically-featured president-cum-human who is rooted in human concerns first. With his ethnicity comes his tie to “the people.” If you take the former view, you get perhaps a corporate “toady”; if you take the latter, you get your warm feelings, your vote for “hope.” This dichotomy rests on the premise that you cannot coherently and clearly dissect Obama into “ethnic” and “presidential” portions, but you can certainly see a faceless and indifferent captain advance the agenda of a faceless and indifferent profit maximization engine.

Is our president beholden to one class over another (corporate over minority classes, say)? Some non-voters might see an undeniably moral conundrum here: voting just means eating your own (enthusiastically so). Nevertheless, if you did not ask yourself this question before voting, again, you probably should not have voted.

“… for the corporation” is most important: Despite the title character’s inspirational resoluteness, his submissiveness wrought his death – of course, he was not destroyed. But will the American people endure such a venture, cleaved to breast an ideology? This is what Nader captures; this is the embodiment of what the term, later interpreted, historically came to mean for black progressives of the 60s and 70s. Will we suffocate with our gods at electric sliding door of this horrible machine, from "profits" and of bailouts? Will our president-elect let us become martyrs? Do not expect the faceless to walk in our shoes, to understand our pain, to possess the compassion Uncle Tom maintained.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Spies and Such</strong>

The examples goes as follows. It is supposed to show how problematic it is for us to quantify into propositional attitude contexts.

Smith lives in an apartment building. He sees a shady figure down the hall. Smith, a paranoid sort, comes to believe that (1) the shady figure is a spy. Later that day, Smith attends a dinner party. Smith meets every person at the party, in particular, the host. Smith finds the host to be a good natured chap. He comes to the belief that (2) this man is not a spy. To put it another way, Smith does not believe this person is a spy. However, as we are philosophers, supposing to our heart's content, let us further suppose that the shady figure and the host of the party are in fact the same person. Thus, it turns out this person, X, bears to properties: the properties of (i) Smith believes X is a spy and (ii) Smith does not believe X is a spy. "Smith does not believe X is a spy" is claimed to follow from "Smith believes X is not a spy." Thus, we have a contradiction in properties that we predicate of our subject, that is, X.

Quine's response is: Do not quantify into propositional attitude contexts (or opaque contexts, environments).

One response I have encountered is that it is fine for Smith to have contradictory beliefs. We "adjust" our beliefs or assent to correction all the time. This seems fine, but does not directly confute the issue of quantification over propositional attitudes being problematic. Granted, Smith is missing an important fact: he does not <em>know</em> that both spy and host are the same person. However, we are not dealing with knowledge. For one, if we accept justified true belief as a conception of knowledge (ignoring a fourth condition and Gettier-thinking), then <em>knowing</em> this fact must presuppose that one at first believes it, the fact being that they are the same person. If he knows it, how did he come to know it? Well, clearly if you introduced him to the fact, he likely would not assent to it (supposing that the host seems to him convincingly non-spy-like). So he might not believe him. But in order for him to know it, he must at first believe it. Will the evidence (justification) convince him if he does not believe it? It being true seems to hold no weight either if Smith is steadfast in his belief. So revealing this fact seems to do nothing for our situation. I think the aim of the JTB route (or any gripes about Smith later coming to just know rather than believes) carries an implicit premise that having contradictory beliefs is acceptable, given that we revise them when we are given new evidence, and that the contradiction in quantification over propositional contexts, if only in this example at least, evaporates at the same time that Smith realizes X<sub>1</sub> (spy-guy) and X<sub>2</sub> (most host) refer to X. In a strong sense, this conception holds that status of contradiction within the proposition tracks the status of the contradiction outside the belief-context (at the level of quantifying into it). Others do not think this is the case.

(a) "... is a spy" and "... is not a spy" are not contradictory. (b) "... believes that ..." and "... does not believe that ..." is not our major concern; though, suppose on the phone Smith recounts the events of his day. He says to his friend, "I saw a spy ... I met an excellent host who I would not believe is a spy." The proponent of this quantification problem, to show that it is a true problem, will say the epistemic possibility of Smith believing that X changes the problem, does not satisfy us if we accept JTB, or might simply be rejected by Smith. We're left at the contradictory properties to which collect under X. This leaves a problem for us because we cannot consistently talk about Smith's beliefs (if we generalize to various other similar situations).

With luck, this sums up the problem. I'll saw my bit on it. Perhaps to your surprise, my remarks will seem like arguments in favor of the "tracking" retort. I'm still working things out. My idea is this: Smith perceives X<sub>1</sub>. The only predicates Smith has for X<sub>1</sub> are "is a spy" or "is a shady figure." For the later encounter with X<sub>2</sub>, Smith has likely "is a good host" and negatively "is not a spy." Again, presumably, the predicate "is not a spy" directly translates into a negative belief: "... does not believe X is Y." I'm really sketchy on how this might look in the predicate calculus, so I cannot suffer a logical showing of this. But we can suppose it possible and valid for our purposes.

My argument has to deal with the representational nature of the contradictory belief statements attributed to Smith. It seems that at the level of belief (Smith believes that...), there is an object within Smith's proposition. (Perhaps my analysis is Russellian.) Smith is asserting, "There is some X" in believing that X<sub>1</sub> is a spy. In this case, Smith seems to never be talking about or referring to the same object when he utters his second belief about X<sub>2</sub>. His two individual beliefs assert the existence of, and are constrained by, the totality of predicates Smith would assent to of each person (X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub>). At the level of proposition, separate objects are therein. At the level of proposition, and due to Smith's evidential contraint (the certain properties manifest to him), Smith must have two disparate entities (X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub>) for his propositions. His mental states, in this case, are about two encounters and thus two individuals. It seems that this cannot be got around <em>at the level of proposition</em>.

In this case, it seems that if the propositions have differing content, they cannot be in contradiction. The predicates (as far as Smith would assert to) constrain the identity of the disparate subjects of those propositions. So, "... is a spy" constrains Smith to believe something like "Spy-guy is a spy" or less analytically "Spy-guy is a shady fellow." And separately, "Bob, the host, is a good host." For Smith, both propositions have content which contain different objects, so restricted by the predicates Smith would assent to of those objects.

<strong>London versus Londres (and modified)</strong>

Suppose Pierre is a monolingual French speaker who lives in a rural town near the French Alps. One day he picks up a magazine titled <em>Londres Aujoud'hui!</em>, and he flips through the magazine. He sees photography of London, England, and comes to the resolute belief that London is pretty. Since he's a monolingual French speaker, he expresses this belief in the French as "Londres est jolie." Pierre returns to his house. A few months pass, and we now see Pierre packing for a journey: he's going to tour the world. He's got a pipe dream conviction to do so. He stows away on a run-down small ship, packed in a heap of salmon. In a few days, a few miles of bus riding, he winds up in London. Quickly, he settles down and starts to learn the language of the Londoners: some variant of English (something we'd likely interpret more or less accurately).

Now, after about 3 months of being Londonized, Pierre calls his friend back at home: "Non, je n'aime pas cet locale. Mais, je dois trouver la London! Londres est jolie!" Unbeknownst to Pierre, however, he is in fact in Londres. He just does not know "Londres" and "London" are the names for the same city. So, does he believe that London is beautiful? (Kripke asks with a certain stubbornness.)

Most would argue that, "hey, once he gets to London, that overrules his previous French expression. It's just an expression. It can be overruled." However, the same situation maintains of "facts" that was present in the last situation. Pierre learns no new fact to which his old belief might be revised, and positing that he should just be told the fact, or that it might be handed to him by God, perhaps, changes the situation we're talking about: on the phone, he's in a state of mind that has contradictory beliefs, it seems, and we cannot for the life of us quantify over it. I try to think of it think way, though it may mess up the example. Pierre has a French-Mental-State (FMS) and an English-Mental-State (EMS). This is what it seems like Kripke is trying to pin us down to, given Pierre's performance. Pierre is "thinking in French" in one case and the referent of his French use seems to be something other than the referent of his English (or Londoner) use, where he's "thinking in English."

One issue many suppose is that "well, now he's in London. Him being in London in fact introduces him to the real London whereas back home he was not properly acquainted." I doubt this argument really does much for we can assume in my modified version that Pierre took the trip first then picked up a mag at a French shoppe <em>before</em> becoming fluent (to whatever extent) in English. In this case, he'll utter "Londres est jolie!" and no one will know what he's talking about (and they won't be able to correct and give the co-referential fact to him because, perhaps, they don't speak a lick of French).

Another issue is the predicate "is pretty." One initial complaint in my philosophy of language class was that the predicate "is pretty" has no extension. There is no set of pretty things. This may sound depressing but it seems intuitive when one considers a view sub specie aeternitatis. However, surely, we might say "pretty relative to culture X." Perhaps. But we can use a different predicate such as "is between X and Y." Perhaps not... I'm losing an example that would actually count as a genuine belief. It seems that when we get into extensional (in principle empirical claims) we reach a problem of the Sorite's paradox (which I will discuss later). It has a strong and a weak sense. The weak, which I'll discuss now, has to do with saying of Pierre's belief that its Sun rises at a certain time. Clearly if this is the case, it would be had to imagine, for our sake, Pierre maintaining such a trivial belief. But further, he would easily be able to falsify it and perhaps use inductive reasoning to conclude that he is in London after all. It seems that we're highly depending on the vague nature of "pretty" in that it allows us to step beyond any naturalistic definition. (I am thinking the naturalistic fallacy is relevant here. Can we say the "is pretty" follows, as a normative or aesthetic term, from non-normative or non-aesthetic things necessarily.) We might be able to say <em>for Pierre</em>, but we'd certainly have no definition of our own to work from. However, that might just be all we need: Pierre's intensional definition of "pretty," what it means for something, in qualitative terms, to be pretty to Pierre. But it seems we're back our own "Sun rising" problem. This leads me to the strong Sorites problem.

First I want to get to my initial argument, though, about the words "London" and "Londres." At first I was thinking in terms of Kripke as far as Pierre appropriating these names in a causally appropriate way. At first, I just though he got two names from disparate initial baptisms. I went further on to think that these linguistic entities, though they may be lexically different and phonetically different, they are not <em>in</em> language the way "est jolie" and "is pretty" are. First off, there's a translation rule which says how to properly grammatically connect the copula "is" and "est" with the property "jolie" and "pretty" to form grammatical predicates. In the most superficial sense, the letter arrangements represent English and French. In this sense, "London" and "Londres" are in language, but I do not think names, in general, have places within the grammar of language. Nouns have no special status in that they can be replaced in any predicative statement and while the statement might change in meaning, it will still be grammatical. But what else can you do with a noun? Well, you can use nouns relationally with prepositions, but you can do this with any noun. This just seems to be a feature of nouns. I am interested in a specific feature to names that seems to not be restricted by Kripke's notion of rigid designators, which is what "London" and "Londres" seem to be (at worlds in which the city exists). We might refer to London with a pronoun, eliminating in certain cases its proper name. What I am getting at is that "London" does not seem to be <em>in</em> the English language as if Pierre is speaking EMS. "London" and "Londres" are not contrasting names of the same object. This conclusion seems wildly in contradiction to the scenario Pierre plays out on the phone with his friend, for it seems that he is using two different names for the same object. (I'm really not sure just how ineffectual this idea is. But it piques me nevertheless.) It seems like these two names just mean "that place over there!", but in Pierre's case it is an empirical matter... He simply did not know where London was or where he was going.

But we do not want the dualism, to say he "believes in the existence of two Londons." There cannot be a London and a Londres to which correspond to Pierre's separate expressions. But thinking this seems to presuppose that Pierre was referring to the same place in both instances of uttering his beliefs. In the latter case, he does not know he's in that place to which he is referring. I'm thinking here that when Pierre says "Londres est jolie" for the first time he's considering himself as though he were there in London after walking through a special door titled "Londres" in his mind. This may also help eliminate the idea of his not being acquainted.

I suppose I will get to my point now... It's related to the Sorites paradox. I have a problem with us being forced to believe that "London" and "Londres" refer to a location with rigid borders. I am thinking that Pierre may have a mobile phone. He may walk to the outskirts of London and say "Cette locale est moche." Will he be talking about London still? Can we verify this? How much of the outskirts of London is actually London? If we suppose a rigid geographic border (and draw a line that demarcates London from say another locale), we could put Pierre on that border. If he steps over it, will he still be in London? Does London <em>expand</em> with his steps and the belief (mental state) that affirms that he is still in London? Is London's border just a product of my mental state? Will he be in contradiction to his previously asserted belief if he actually steps outside of London by an inch?

Further, to which section of London did the pictures he initially saw capture? It seems like a bold presupposition to make that the words "London" and "Londres" must refer to all parts of town for every speaker. So we suppose that Pierre read about Downtown London but decided to proclaim something about all of London. Well, this just makes no sense. Surely he would not assent to the claim, "So you believe all of London is pretty based on what you just read about it?" Might he admit the possibility of error? Is it fair to say "suppose the error away"? I do not think you can "hold him to his word." Again, if he's in a town, would he say the whole town is "ugly" if he very well knew he had not seen it all. My point is that given these facts, <em>we</em> seem to be in a bind with even attending to our variables for quantification.

It seems that "London" refers to a geographic approximation. What if the place he lives in is called "London" by all the speakers for short of "Lesser London" because the inhabitants do not want to always invoke bad feelings? They want to be closer to the image of London. And suppose the photos of London were in fact photos of London still. Suppose further than Lesser London is very geographically close to London and it only recently was dismembered because the Londonites wanted to be rid of the trash. This occurs during Pierre's trek. I suppose this changes the situation too much.

I do not think these names can refer to a name as though it were not already defined. But did Pierre define the borders of London? 

It seems like the two belief statements are being treated as being ontologically different when they are in fact only epistemologically different. Take the representationalist view again: there's an object of London in the proposition with a certain set of features from the photo... This seems like the "acquaintance"  again...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kripke's claim is that if we discover some cat is a robot, we will not say "no cats exists." We will in fact say, "Whoops. Looks like we were wrong about cats." This is the epistemic sense in which it is "less necessary" than "bachelors are unmarried men."

However, Kripke proposes "cats might turn out to be demons," in the metaphysical sense. He puts "demon" and "animal" on the same ontological footing. He does this to say that if something is a demon, then it is not an animal. If something is an animal, then it is not a demon. But if these two kinds sit on the same level, when I propose that "cats might be demons" or "cats have always been demons," suggesting that this paradigmatic instance is just "cat-like" or is a facade seems unfair. No, I mean to say "cats have always been demons and cats are a kind of demon--they have been all alone; they just gave the first blush of looking like animals."

It seems like Kripke just stipulates the empirical matter but "animal" and "demon" would theoretically be contrasting classes. Kripke treats "demon" as if it were a something sitting on the same level as "cats" when he should be treating it as if it were contrasted against "animal." There are many kinds of demon in various mythologies. Perhaps kinds of robots too: R2-D2, C-3PO, Data, the fancy ones of the future, etc.

Further, I do not see why Kripke admits talk of demons as if it were an empirical thing. He treatment of unicorns could be applied to demons. He's argued that unicorns necessarily do not exist in the metaphysical sense. Thus, he's argued that demons necessarily do not exist. To which mythology would we attribute our "demon" finding to? If we found cats-as-demons, we'd likely not even have a mythology because it's likely non-existent that association of cat and demon (Ancient Egypt mythos?). But we have no way, in principle, to conclude that a cat is a demon. So it seems that, at best, Kripke's conclusion is, given his treatment, that [if] cats are demons, then we could never find this out because  we'd have no confirming evidence (epistemic sense). We might just be talking about fool's demons, or the wrong story.

But the appeal to "myth," an ancient story, is strong in Kripke. Unicorns, assumes Kripke, are mythical species. Further, so many stories are written about them. I fail to see how suggesting that the myths are wrong about the internal structure shows that no unicorns exist...it might simply show that unicorns in the way myth X, Y and Z conceive. But surely there's a common attribute each unicorn of every myth shares. The "disparate descriptions" argument Kripke gives I think fails. Internal structure perhaps is a bit different. 

I'm sure the argument is an easy one that follows that Aristotle wrote much of animals and surely they did exist, regardless of there being an account of their internal structure.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1. In language carries our beliefs as vessel, but we can be like archaic vessels lost in a labyrinth.

2. Twins conjoined at the head claim they are happy. The philosopher asks, "Are they really happy?" We are being pushed to think their is a dichotomy. There's a predicate pristine that the philosopher likely believes she's got, and that she wants you to believe she's got the necessary and sufficient conditions of--it's the Socratic Scare (someone <em>end</em> must have the end-condition to <em>this</em> particular language game--another unjustified dissection). That decadent and dopey postmodernist inside shouts something, looking theatrical as feigning an emotion, "We are not in a position to judge such situation!" They treat being conjoined at the skull as if it were a lifestyle...almost by choice. This is the absurd madness the philosopher introduces: a skepticism for the weak to hang their ideology on, a banner of a sort. "We grow up in different backgrounds. We do know understand their happiness. It's indeterminate." The scientist informs us, "We disjoined the twins. Ask them again." Of course, we each of us bite. "But were they 'really' happy before?" This is the nonsense (strict) we must account for, a term bleeding in the bellows of language. Coherency is lost with either the affirmative or the negative: if "yes," we accept a twin's claim that happiness can be revised and we are left with the question in any case "Is this twin happy now?" Asking it at all looks as if the twin had answered "no." So she says "no"; we say, "Aha! We have found a new property to attach to "happiness." It now involves being individual in one's physical person. Did we not look for this answer anyway in asking the question? The postmodern wears a pitiful and unconvincing mask of skepticism and openness. Let's say they were happy in both cases. We could observe them and this might turn out true for span of their lifetime. In another set of twins' case: it turns out they were never happy to begin with and that was a viral thing within their lives. Some happy after, some happy only before. Have we said anything about happiness except that it is a multifaceted term? a term who's necessary and sufficient conditions elude us. Will we commit the naturalistic fallacy and say "you must explain why you are happy in <em>my</em> terms." Chairs! They make me happy, but that they do is something to which you can never understand. We think we have added something on top of this mundane situation by positing "peculiar cases" like twins. We must accept the "logical behaviorist" who forces us to look at the contextual conditions as giving us the shifting essence of our terms. Happiness is <em>that</em> right there. Look and see for yourself. Will the Fallacy be committed here? Why should we be militaristic with our notion of the criteria for "happiness," other terms?

Of course <em>you</em> can judge. If anything, you are the only person who can. Happiness is not a private emotion, and happiness certainly isn't manifest, emergent, ostensible in the laboratory (both philosophico-methodological and physical) just because we intend or expect it to be.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The diluted Christian claims that "abortion under the right circumstances is fine by me, but under the wrong circumstances, I will say it should not be permitted." The circumstances of the abortion will be the contributing factor as to whether it is judged right or wrong, acceptable or unacceptable. The argument goes that "having an abortion for aesthetic reasons" is wrong. So much for the artists; I think the Christian suggests the vanity of style of evil, sinful or something along these lines. A mother should not have an abortion because her baby is a boy <em>rather</em> than a girl. The circumstances which are approved are those involving "life or death" of the mother or child (which we won't touch on) and the "inconvenience" argument. If a mother will find abortion to be an inconvenience, then that permits it. What counts as "inconvenience"? Monetary situation? Let's speak strictly outside of terms of health. If we do this, it seems like certain "inconvenience" token arguments look very similar to "aesthetic" arguments. "Look, having blond hair instead of brown just is an inconvenience for me. What if my child cannot get into Harvard (because Harvard has been admitting, on average, more brown tops than blond--suppose this woman is really peculiar at choosing inductive variables), that would very much inconvenience me in certain ways." Is the form of the argument permitting of such an odd token?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I will introduce some new terms, and an attempt to clarify them will not be forthcoming. Perhaps they will be "high definitions" or their meaning will be unclear. Consider this a methodological dogma (rationalism).

Moore claims that (1) I know that this is a hand, thus I know I am not dreaming as contrapositive to (2) I do not know that I am not dreaming, thus I do not know this is a hand. Moore subsequently and entertainingly waves his hands. The argument is more subtle than this. The truth of (i) I know this is a hand and (ii) I know this other is a hand shows that when conjoined, (iii) I know I have hands follows. The idea is that (1) and (2) are logically equivalent and (1) is more plausible than (2).

My refutation of the skeptic centers on coherency of story. The skeptic wants us to believe all the sensible qualities of the world are consistent with dreaming. But does the skeptic claim that coherency of dreaming, or being a brain in a vat, is consistent? I know that I am not dreaming because of the semantic space in which dreams and waking take stage. In dreaming peculiar things occur. Objects may or may not bear their usual (in waking) features. A cat, for instance, my have 4 legs in my dream, but I recall that same cat in waking as having four. It is inconsistent waking, as we may suppose, that the cat have 3 legs in dreaming. This will increase our awareness, perhaps, of our dreaming. Under assumption, waking does not involve our cats having 3 legs and them sprouting a fourth. I suppose this does not involve semantic space, but it is the coherence in which semantic space must take place. It is an assumption that objects correspond to certain features. Thus, "grass is green" if and only if grass is green refers to a state of affairs. Grass becoming blue is consistent, from a metaphysical standpoint. Its atomic structure may be different so as to be conducive to us perceiving blue grass as opposed to green grass. But grass is spaghetti? Well, we might recall Descartes' claim of "mundane events" that take place in dreams. So we must take Descartes hypothesis and ignore very peculiar situations like grass is spaghetti. But must we suppose that the arch-skeptic further supposes that the dream be "coherent in the mundane" sense? Will dreams not at first blush seem mundane in coherence (general features of consistency)? This seems agreeable. But will <em>all</em> features be coherent so as to have no inconsistency whatsoever? The dream-demon may strive for coherency in tricking our consciousness. But I exert my power in assuring that the dream is coherent internally. Other persons will interpret my "dreaming life" or my "waking life" incorrectly. I will exert my power to correct the inconsistency of the state of affairs. Can the dream-demon cause all agents within my dreaming or waking to present inconsistency for something about me? Someone recalls a story about me incorrectly. I correct this person. Will I have at this point adjusted the parameters of my dreaming? Do I have this kind of power insofar as our usual conception of dreaming?

I know this story as coherent, thus I know I am not dreaming.
I do not know I am not dreaming, thus I do not know this story as coherent.

But it seems I can map to the world through coherence, if not correspondence. My effort to make the world cohere eliminates a feature of dreaming: its incoherence. Are dreams always coherent? Well, Cartesian Skeptics may posit that all of our dreams can be coherent and mundane. Fine. Does the dream-demon have control over what I will see as coherent and as incoherent qua story? The stories will be layered, agent A this, agent B that story that is inconsistent with my own. I will exert my power to "align" the stories, to correct them, to make them coherent.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Categorical Imperative as Epistemic Modal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."</blockquote>

<strong>Gloss:</strong> Let us look at what concerns an immediate failure of the first formulation of the categorical imperative. First, we concern ourselves with the pre-theoretical, namely, the conditions which might precede the application of such an intellectual tool. Our general concern is the presupposition of a morally closed universe of discourse. More specifically, <em>in which</em> domains ought we apply the categorical imperative? Kant gives us examples of "lying" and "murder" and "giving into providing information to a murderer." What is it that is presupposed in these situations? Lying is assumed to be a terrible thing which needs justification. Why would we ever assume such an "inherent" as that which is in the <em>lie.</em> The lie supervenes on the circumstance: Will we judge, from theoretical standpoint, lies as such or lies as manifest (acquiring a nature subsequent to) from the circumstances in which one's act was involved? Kant demands that we ignore the consequences in a material sense but utilize consequence, nevertheless, as a theoretico-methodological tool. In perceiving ourselves as being affected by consequence in this method, we find ourselves exploiting ourselves as a means to some end. The subject must conceive of a world in which the subject is erased, subsumed under some manifest ontology, so that the imperative make properly take place in the projected theory.

Why might I not choose "stepping on beetles" or "slamming the door"? If I choose to apply the imperative to the mundane, which very well might transfer into severe moral issues, I could at the same time convert myself into something inert. Naturally, in accepting the imperative, I must enter a theoretical point with a background of moral leanings. But will this background properly yield a contradiction or simply given me vacillation of mind? The violence done to one's intellect is what I experience. I can imagine no further when I conceive the world, as best I can, through the filter of the imperative. In taking the steps of playing our this theoretical world to its contradictory end when and where along this path might I halt satisfied with that contradiction I strove to derive? Which acts, if any, fall under the imperative's purview? Perusal of all action gives us nothing useful, gives us absurdity. Some action, thus, is our target. But which action? Why must we investigate only certain kinds of lies? It seems that if we have a specific lie, a specific kind of lie, we have analytically derived a contradiction. But presumably analytic statements have nothing to do with this world. If true, I might as well consider "2+2=4" as the guiding principle for how I might educate my children, testify in court, and so on. But clearly this, too, is an absurd foundation for one's moral principles.

"...whereby you <em>can will</em>..." grounds us, I believe, in the modal. Is it possible at all to apply the imperative? Might our epistemic limit preclude us in all cases from doing so? I do not harp on the consequences whereby we might judge our imperative's success. But I raise issue with it being conceivable at all that any one of us might indeed employ it. It seems better to modify the formulation as "... whereby you <em>might wish</em>..." Kant presumes the human capacity to employ it where I perceive the human desire to employ it, and not in all cases but only some. Kant's formulation strikes me as pitting the will against the intellect, but Spinoza informs me that they are one and the same, one does not stretch beyond the other. But in desiring to extend one's will one has only <em>chosen</em> at some point to do so. The issue of intellect falls through the cracks, and we take stance in assuming the background of our application of the imperative, perhaps of any moral decision, as absurd.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) "Too much of X is bad for you." Is this analytic? Can "too much of X" be viewed in terms of its material properties so as to generate a naturalistic fallacy a la Moore? Does this depend on the content of X? X=lovin'! X=Love! Well, we can look at material composition (components manifesting) of love--is this what we say there is too much of when there is "too much" of it? Does the "too much of X" locution bear logical equivalence to "bad"? "Bad stuff is bad for you." But we seem to be counting: "how much is too much?" is a typical response. If you must ask this, then you cannot be conceived of the moral propositional content. There will be none for the bearer of this question. But they might be sold: in principle, however, this question is philosophical, puzzling. One who wishes not to pursue it will not show that it is not a puzzle, but that it is pragmatically futile to do so.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The term "good" lacks natural properties. Agent A cannot be said to necessarily predicate of conjoined properties {X, Y, Z} as set that it is "good." In some cases, we may find {X, Z}, and A may only <em>believe</em> {X, Y, Z} are present. The X and Z may in fact cause Y to manifest in some cases, whereas in other cases they may not. Thus, A may use "good" to predicate of the set when that set does not bear its usual constituent properties. Will the application of "good" even occur under these conditions so set? Can we imagine our agent never being deceived or being overly presumptive perhaps? What if we suggest all the properties consisting the set are eliminated so that we must conceive of A as "conceiving in isolation" the set or collection. Will we say the idea of the set is "good" or the natural manifestation of it must be "good"? Is there truly a conflict between good-as-type and good-as-token? Do types have natural properties by which we might predicate of them with "goodness"?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Premise: Statements uttered bear propositional content.
Contraposition: Non-propositional content is not contained within a statement.

A statement on paper, as example, say, has no attitudinal content, but does bear a propositional content. This will be its "literal" or "isolated" content; thus, we rightly label its status as such.

(C)ats have four legs; (C) has literal content. (F)isk believes (C); (F) has attitudinal content. A belief alone requires no justification for it, however, it will possess as (F)-type, a collection of contingent world-fixing components that give it life, viability as a sincere belief. A belief with no world-fixing component is typically considered as vacuous. Thus, (S)usan believes (G)od exists is considered a vacuous belief by the atheist who holds as premise (G')od is not attached or related to the world. Naturally, the next step is to discuss the constitution (physical or otherwise) of the world. But that discussion will not fall under my purpose here.

Knowledge, as is commonly held, counts when a subject, or agent, is related to a belief, just so described, a true fact and a justification (not as merely "reason for" in the way that the belief came about). The agent must be related in the "appropriate way." Suggesting the causally appropriate way as the means by which a person comes to a belief leaves us wanting for the "justification," when we see that belief as "odd" or unintuitive or false. If X acknowledges the belief of Y only insofar as X adheres to the causal appropriation thesis, X may still be left to, or find herself wishing to, inquire as to its justification. We must ask, then, what is the relation between the causal story of the belief's manifestation and the justification so given for that belief. This may come before or after determining that belief's truth-value. Thus, we have a triple relation between the causal story, the truth-value, and the justification. The truth-value's determination is grounded in the truth-conditions for that statement's being possibly justified. Here we see the connection between justification and truth-value. A justification accounts for the truth-conditions for a statement being true. Further, we might be inclined to say that a statement bearing no truth-conditions at all cannot possibly, or necessarily does not, become the constituent of a attitudinal context. Thus, a subject cannot possibly, or necessarily does not, entertain the statement. 

Looks may be deceiving: it certainly looks <em>as if</em> the statement is being entertained. We will say, "Ah, look. This man is flailing about and uttering just like the college professor does. Of course his utterances bear a (propositional) content." But surely this cannot be the sole justification for such a view. It is patently an absurd premise, for it assumes a condition of "rationality as producing rational behavior." If we look at "rational behavior," we can infer rational entertainment of a propositional content. But this assumes exactly that which is contested, namely that content of all sort is rational. We are taken off course to look at rational behavior rather than the target set before us.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1. We are taught to apply our theory; destroy the puzzle! Show that <em>this</em> puzzle or <em>that</em> paradox is not evil, but neutral.

2. We are taught not to dabble in the meta-this or meta-that. Our metas must solve those puzzles. We must talk about the <em>world</em>. Ever does the world consist of the puzzle, and ever shall we seek to dissolve it. Our theory must be toxic to it.

3. And when we speak of our meta-qualms about those mundane things, we are told to hush. Outright illegitimate is our cry if it yields no posit <em>for the better</em>. Our largest enemy is performativity. A virtuous theory is a theory that gives us from what is not given, and the given is what is not given but posited as the given as if it were given.

4. We are taught that sentences like the one tailing 3 are "nonsense," which carries a weird underpinning feature of "dislike." The essence of all philosophy: Does it make me happy? How absurd to think happiness is a part of anything--to think it is even a word. We play the queer game of supposing it is a piece of our rank, a tool of ours, a thing that does not indeed escape thinghood. 

5. And we shout the obviousness of it (that sentence tailing 3). We shout its driving on the borders of thought. We replace the terms, the components, and we get your theory of the mundane. We approached it a different way; this is the criteria by which our theory is judged. But it gives no result. It is <em>empty </em>under the constraints of pragmatism, and it cannot be <em>over </em>the constraints of the "World" so presupposed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>On one hand, dominating public opinion, one had 'democracy'--in its entirely corrupt representative and electoral form--and 'freedom' reduced to the freedom to trade and consume. These constituted the abstract universality of our epoch. That is, this alliance between the market and parliamentarism--what I call 'capitalo-parliamentarism'--functioned as if the only possible doctrine, and on a worldwide scale. On the other hand, one had the widespread presence of relativism. Declarations were made to the effect that all cultures were of the same value, that all communities generated values, that every production of the imaginary was art, that all sexual practices were forms of love, etc. In short, the context combined the violent dogmatism of mercantile 'democracy' with a thoroughgoing scepticism which reduced the effects of truth to particular anthropological operations. Consequently, philosophy was reduced to being either a laborious justification of the universal character of democratic values, or a linguistic sophistry legitimating the right to cultural difference against any universalist pretension on the part of truths.
--Alain Badiou, <em>Being and Event</em></blockquote>

Premises are in serious need of revision; their bleeding profusely into our model will be condoned until they effect an insignificant collapse, the only kind appropriate to a collapse of insignificance.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>London and Pierre&#039;s content</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Strong contradiction: [Pierre believes London is pretty] ^ [Pierre <em>does not</em> believe London is pretty]
Weak contradiction: [Pierre believes London is pretty] ^ [Pierre believes London is <em>not </em>pretty]

Intuitive response: People <em>refer</em>; this trumps the logical behavior of a name. Thus, "London" and "Londres" simply being the object, the city, falls out during Pierre's referring. Pierre refers to <em>his</em> "Londres" and <em>his</em> "London." He's referring to his mode of presentation, where each mode accounts for this or that situation under which Pierre perceives London.

Counterclaim: What does the Fregean say when she stands in front of Pierre and asks, "Do you think <em>this</em> place is ugly?" Pierre might respond, "<em>Look</em> around you. This <em>(points)</em> place is ugly!" Is Pierre still referring to his mode of presentation at this point? It seems easier to say Pierre is referring to the object within a mode of presentation, but this example seems to suggest this response is flawed. Will Pierre's quasi-demonstrative and use of the name "London" refer only to some mental content? Will it refer to a propositional content that does not involve the actual city of London? Is London <em>in</em> the proposition?

Contradictory Beliefs:

Pierre cannot be said to have contradictory beliefs unless the content of each belief has the same objects and properties. It's implausible that Pierre's belief contains the object to which "London" refers. Beliefs do not contain objects like cities. However, Pierre is predicating some thing. Is it possible for Pierre to refer to all of London? When Pierre expresses a belief, can he be said to be employing the Millian name? What is London? What counts as London? If I walk through London briefly... Does predicating of a city with "is pretty" have a criteria (be)for(e) use? Must I satisfy some conditions before I can use it?

Possible worlds are future states of affairs for some modal statements.

The Fregean solution to Kripke's puzzles leaves us communicating by coincidence. When we refer to objects, it is mere coincidence that the object of our reference is being presented propositionally. Our use of names presupposes a database, as it were, of established descriptions, none of which is statement-ostensible. These pre-linguistic semantic properties of the referent for the background of the referent. So "London" for Pierre has "seen in a mag," "described to me last Wednesday by Claude," "had rain last Tuesday," etc. None of these properties are on the table. They more or less build a story of the referent. Nevertheless, when Pierre refers to London, he means some shifting set or family of those properties. Two speakers refer to their families of properties, and they talk about London because of their community reference perhaps.

The Russellian still has to deal with "The present president of the United States might not be the present president of the United States." "Obama might not be the president of the United States" has sense. But if names are abbreviated descriptions, then the former proposition is permitted by the Russellian account.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Premise: Some words have literal meaning.
Premise: God deliberated; God deliberates; God will deliberate; God will have deliberated; God aspires to deliberate*; God necessarily deliberates; God might not have deliberated (epistemic impossibility for human beings to even surmise); God deliberates at time t; God intends to deliberate; God intends; etc.
Conclusion: God does not deliberate; God does not intend.

<em>or </em>

Conclusion: Some words <em>must</em> have nonstandard, nonliteral meaning. When involved in talk exchanges, do not consider words' literal or standard meaning.

How will we account for "deliberation" and "foreknowledge"? "Intention" and "foreknowledge"?

---

Assumption: God intended X.
Fact: X occurred.
Conclusion: Therefore, God intended X.

---

A prerequisite for will is that we forget. Thus, God cannot be an agent in any coherent sense. Would we say it is possible for God to forget something 2 months ago? Let the absurdities flow...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Suppose we divide a room into two halves with a veil. One half of the room has its feathers ruffled while the other is left in tact. We have a child walk into the half of the room that is left in tact. The child utters, "This room is pretty!" We lead the child into the other half of the room (unbeknownst to the child: the veil). The child then assents to the sentence, "This room is ugly!" We ask of the child, "What do you think of that other room?" "It is very pretty!" is his response. Of course, these are just two halves of the same room. Does the child believe the room is pretty?

The Fregean will have to say, When the child experiences the room under one mode of presentation, a semantico-linguistic context is built which tracks the physical demarcations we've set up. "The room," for the child, depending on question, refers to this half or that half. The child has two "rooms" for each mode of presentation. But this seems odd. When the child is standing in the cluttered room, we are ascribing to him a mode of presentation for which he will assent or dissent from. But while <em>standing in</em> the room, is he assenting to the state of the room or his mode of presentation? Does this escape the fact that he's in one room? Have we created "two rooms"? Will the child believe he's in two different rooms? When we remove the veil, will he assent to the claim, "These two rooms are in fact one"? What happens if we split the room into four quadrants, divided by the same sort of veil. Twenty veils? In each case, will "room" have a different sense in each case?

The Fregean says, "He intends to describe this section of the room, not those other sections." But if we ask, "Do you think this section of the room is pretty?" we might give away our stipulated situation. We will be modifying our example. But the Fregean wants to say "this section of the" is implicit; it's captured by "there is some mode of presentation under which." But what does this do for our noun phrase "the room"? It seems its referring property falls apart if we admit "sections" which map to modes of presentation.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Global Rules, Local Rules &amp; AI</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What would a global rule look like, supposing any to exist. A global rule, by definition, ignores the constraints that would define a local rule (as instantiation of global rule). A global rule that in principle could be derived as local is essentially not global. If, in principle, a local rule could be tied back to a global rule, then that global rule is not essentially <em>global</em>. A global rule bears a property that emerges which can only persist at the topmost level of this chain. This emergent property is a global rule that cannot be possessed by any subordinate rule (for if it could, it would not be a globally emergent property, and we would thus perceive it at some local context).

Would an AI system possess any global rules? Again, what would a global rule look like?

Thou shalt not kill <em>under any circumstances</em>
X + Y = Y + X
If A, then A.
If A is true, then A or B is true.
Subsequently, if A or B is true, then A or B or C is true.

Are these global rules? Do they persevere only within a local context, say, at the grocery store or in one culture as opposed to another? What is "context"? What would a context look like? Are its boundaries derived from <em>expectation</em>, by pragmatic constraints or epistemic limitations? How might a context shift or blend into another? Is there any sense to be had of a "global context"? If "global context" is nonsense, then it would seem a global rule has no domain for its application. "Global context" just means "the sum total of all local contexts." But which properties do local contexts share? That they are "local" or "have relations" seem to be vacuous properties. Why would we suggest that "global rules" apply to each local context when the context itself might be radically, or philosophically, incomparable to another. What about <em>this</em> context demands that I employ the supposed global rule that Y + X = X + Y? Is it that it is "rational" to do so? That we've always expected as such, and thus we are given our boundary? That we might bite the evolutionary bullet if we do not?

AI systems will take the "global context" axiom. All local contexts simply must be treated as having some likeness with respect to each other. The shared property, which grounds the decision procedure, will be "this is a local context; local contexts take <em>this</em> rule." Global rule, however, will have no logical foundation except from the axiom, which as we have said, is a faith, as irrational as belief substance (that one has--religiously--perceived or--philosophically--conceived substance aright).

Of course, local contexts will have unbounded variables. They will not be bound to the (existential) generalization that is the rule. This is unsurprising. Limitation on the cognizing capacity of the AI system will allow for various nouveau entities. However, what of manifest nouveau local rules? Will the rule be perceived as object and integrated without worry? We can imagine rule trumping rule, but for what reasons? This is our worry.

Are "global rules" about the world?

Dennet supposes that a robot may purchase milk based on a "cost-effective" rule. Perhaps a "convenience" rule as well may count as a "global rule." Convenience rules would be egoistic; cost-effective rules would be economic-intensive. What factors into "cost-effective"? Budget with the background of how "local" of the given economy? So we look to averages for our parameters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Literalist:</strong>
I believe that God exists.

Corollary:
Rightly deemed lunatic, supposing there are any left who genuinely hold "God exists" to express some truth about the world rather than about <em>this </em>world. Why so rash and forward on this? Any speech act involving the <em>telos</em> places you without question into the moderate category: a consequentialist believer is a moderate believer. The question is: What counts one as a consequentialist? I doubt anyone can avoid such a label. It is the storytellers, the marveler, the wonderer, the philosopher, the amazed, the dazzled and dreaming, the rationalizer, the emoter, the reactionary, the pundit, the modest, the artist, the aestheticist; honestly, if you are conscious at all, you likely fall into this <em>telos</em>-tick. But the literalist, should it exist, is permitted to speak because we have in our control the ability to not listen; when the story becomes clearly too fanciful for our wit or mustard, we will await the modicum moment that the platform on which the literalist speaks disappears. By the gears, windings, workings and rules of polite communication, we see the end to the tunnel of the mundane in terms of the terms of art of certain, privileged mythology.

<strong>Hedonist Moderate:</strong>
I believe that believing that "God exists" is a good belief to have.

Corollary: This is a pragmatico-utilitarian line, which falls under the broader religio-consequentialist line. God, or belief in God, is seen for its fruits. Indeed, we might as well put God in scare-quotes for the first disjunct. "God" in essence becomes the limit of the cultural imagination. Here's where we get benign or artistic (existentialist) pantheism, where the "collective [WORD]" arranges the properties of its most popular deity (the ontologically dominant entity of its zeitgeist). Here, pantheism and monotheism of the moderate have no concretely distinguishing properties. Their linguistic behavior produces a quiesce of ideological strife, consent is borne from the property-blending of statements, referents of statements are masked by intuition and good-feelings. "God exists" for one is simply assumed to mean roughly the same for all, where the mode of presentation strictly does not fall out. The culture is parasitic on the nature of this generalization ("God exists" just means "Some god exists"). And everyone person may have its delightful deity in this pathological pool of noncommunication, drenched in the wires of progress, poetry and pity.

<strong>Merciful Atheist:</strong>
I believe that Y believing that "God exists is a good belief to have" is good belief for others to have.

Corollary:
This line of reasoning involves the atheist in the belief that literalists are blind and thus are by their nature unable to step beyond the cognitive capacity of at least the moderate. The atheist here sees the ills of religion but imagines a world darker, more cursed, vile and horrid. For the sake of avoiding such a state of affairs, the atheist will avoid dissemination of the "higher learning" and the "politically correct." The atheist will see themselves as stepping into the age of reason, thus to countenance a kind of aristocratic intellegentsia. It will be a condescension for the <em>only possible good</em>, constrained by the principle, of course, of utility.

These positions are <em>exhaustive</em> and <em>mutually exclusive.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) God exists as an agent.

(1) is false. No one can conceive it as true. We are agents. If you believe in God, you believe in something that can have no psychological status similar to our own. Thus, God does not have agency, will, intelligence, desire, hope, any of the moods or emotions; God cannot suppose, deliberate, have intentions, have consciousness of any flavor (collective or unary), etc. 

The term "God" cannot be put into any proposition without reducing it to meaninglessness because "God" is a term to which no object corresponds (it does not pick out a concrete object and the abstract object it picks out has only a mode of presentation). That is, each person encounters the term under the condition of his or her own material and cultural conditions. Thus, "God" is the product of their culture, society, etc, but it literally has no object. It is the source of psychological improvement or debasement, or whatever. Arguing over the behavior of how Christians ought to be is a mug's game. All you can conclude is that "Belief in God is a good belief to have for some, but not for others."

Answer the question of why cultures ascribe different properties to God in the first place. And no, don't answer it in a "historical mode" of thought. Anyone can imagine a world filled with stories and tradition which would persuade any of us. Jesus did this, the Bible had commandments, Moses walked here, the Scripture is a source of hope and inspiration, etc--this still does not address why God is given the properties it has. Why must God be given "powers" or a "psychological nature"? It's plain that God cannot logically have these things, yet people ascribe these properties to it.

If we were a warrior tribe, we'd say God is our best fighter.

If we were postmoderns, we'd say God is everybody else's God.

If we were Tritarian Protestants, we'd say God is Father but also Son to match up with our neurosis and quasi dissociative identity disorder. (I am both father and son of my own life; sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow.)

If we're existentialists, we say we are God.

If we're triangles, we say we are the particulars which instantiate the Pure Form of the Triangle.

If we're atheists, we say science is the new god (but we don't know a lot of science, so in effect, the scientific community is the new god).

We can play with analogs all day long. But why at all do we press ourselves to think in this hierarchy? We in all cases debase ourselves, for we give God the form we only think we crudely represent. Why do we "represent" a form? Why is there a "form" at all?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Scripture against unisex clothing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Deuteronomy 22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.</blockquote>

I wonder how the Fundamentalist/Moderate would address this issue of unisex clothing, not to mention the absurdity that just about everyone is a walking abomination. What's more, what follows from being an "abomination" unto the LORD in this case? What are the consequences? As usual, I'm sure most moderate Christians will play the "Jesus-repeal" card. <em>Boring.</em>

Future Goal:
Let's take a stab at the "gender-role model" of the Scripture. We may be able to derive that the basis for contemporary Scriptural backlash against same-sex marriage comes from this gender-role model manifest in Scripture. If this model does not stand up in contemporary culture, we may well conclude that the Scripture has nothing to legitimately say about same-sex marriage, gender roles, and perhaps a slew of other related issues. 

Questions:
What are some tenets of the model?
Who is divided? What is its cultural ontology?
What are the rules that support it?
What are its effects generally?
How is it justified? Can it be justified?
What is a gender role today? Then?
Do gender roles exist at all? Are they justified?
Can the notion of a role necessarily be attached to a sex?
How do roles fit in with other areas of the cultural system? Then? Now?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Will is an intensity to desire an object. Freedom comes in when you are not prevented from obtaining the object so desired. "Free will" is the combination of this negative freedom and the predisposition to intensely will a certain object or state of affairs or event. We could call an event an object, of course.

Intention plays little role in determining the freedom of others, as we cannot quantify it (and this is what we want to do). However, we must posit it as relevantly involved in the action of each agent. Falling out of bed has no "intent" because it has no intentionality. There is nothing "about" that state of affairs which the agent willed or was "free" to choose. But more importantly, our standard conception of "free will" involves the representation of propositional content. That is, we have a state of affairs we wish to see obtained; this involves that an agent be free in some sense to obtain that event, has any old magnitude of desire to do so, and that there is an aboutness that the agent holds of that event (usually called a relational attitude or propositional attitude).

<blockquote>{Harry} [wishes] (to see Susan).</blockquote>

{X} = Agent
[X] = Propositional Attitude / Intentionality (the way in which Harry is related to his content.)
(X) = The content of the proposition.

You might not think "to see Susan" as a self-standing proposition. But it is idiomatic when we look at this structuring I have given.

We must add the subjunctive "that" in order to make the statement clear.

<blockquote>{Harry} [wishes] that ({he} will see Susan.)</blockquote>

{Agent}, [Intentionality], (State of Affairs)

If Harry is not prevented from seeing that this state of affairs obtains, then we will call this a free action.]]></content:encoded>

But we can alter our motive once we have a clear one in view. Would this mean that our original motive was not a motive at all, but simply an antecedent to its final removal?

I am motivated to X.

I wish not to obtain X.
I am no longer motivated to X.
There must be some contrasting set of objects that can be the candidates for motivation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cognitive off-loading: the act of marking an external object <em>as container</em> for a set of future behavior. Thus, we remember to perform an action or a set of actions after processing a perceived point, as opposed to remember those tasks fully. In a way, we "unload" memories, objects, from our consciousness and establish a "pointer" in the world. The coffee pot becomes a "pointer" for actions {A, B, C}. These actions may be linguistic behavior or physical actions. A=Ask others if they wish to have coffee; B=Check if the pot is empty; C=Look for filters. Point is: From a Humean perspective, the constant conjunction of events could be a constant conjunction of actionable future states of affairs. Approaching the coffee pot is an "approximated event" of "preparing coffee." This just means the event does not always look the same (my clothes might be different; the time may be different). However, the future event itself has a set of properties (A, B, C). Those properties themselves follow a Humean setup. C presupposes that filters will be found or are available (or are at least purchasable or are in the world--some evil demon hasn't devoured them all). So Event Z may have properties {A,B,C} where X follows from Z probabilistically and {A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>} follow probabilistically within the framework of other logical threads.

Linguistic events as well. Suppose you are hypnotized and told, "When I ring this bell, you will believe you are in pain." We are asked, Do you actually feel pain, or do you only <em>believe</em> it? A physical check will determine that you have no physical damage. A psychical check will determine that you have no grounds for feeling pain, but nevertheless you <em>may</em> report it. This is supposed to show that pain can be detached from a report of pain. It seems, then, that sometimes we may report pain, outside of an experimental (rigorous) setting, when we are in fact not in pain. (Eh...) But you are asked, "Do you feel <em>pain</em> at this moment?" (After the bell is rung.) Perhaps the question is not asked. Perhaps the bell is rung, and you are observed. You utter, "I feel a pain in my left forearm." (Suppose you were told to feel a specific pain.) The propositional content of "I believe that I am in pain" has no correspondence, presumably, with the physical state of the agent. "I am in pain" will be false because the truth-conditions of the proposition will read "no pain." However, linguistically, at the level of utterance, the statement will be meaningless. (Sentences alone do not have truth-conditions unless they are analytic.) "I am in pain" is analytic? or synthetic? "I am in pain"--can this report have implicature? 

My initial thought is that "responding to the bell or a bell" does not fit into the background of agent's dispositions. We cannot say "responding with a belief that one in pain is just something we tend to do when in the presence of ringing bells." Alas... Nevertheless, what is the relation between "bell" and "pain-belief-report"? Is there one? Would a knock on the door do just the same? Perhaps these are important questions; perhaps not...

Event(ring) is relation to Event(pain-belief-report), or Event(ring) is related to Event(pain-sensation). Does a pain sensation necessarily entail that it will be reported? Sometimes I do not report (in an approximated way) my pain given my context. I am at work; I will not vocalize my pain. Is "reporting of such and such" always determined by a context? Is being hypnotized suppose to trigger our cognitive system into thinking "I can be as sincere and open as I'd like!" But this seems to give us a "blank slate" report. Why does this kind of report matter? Is it the essence of reporting? Is the nature of this kind of report related to "reports-in-a-context." I do not consider the scientific experiment a "real" context. It is a farce to me until I can establish the relation between belief-reports in experiment and belief-reports in the social world. An immediate thought is: The control given to the scientist precludes any notion of the Social.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>    According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything intelligently, his act is preceded and steered by another internal act of considering a regulative proposition appropriate to his practical problem. [...] Must we then say that for the hero's reflections how to act to be intelligent he must first reflect how best to reflect how to act? The endlessness of this implied regress shows that the application of the criterion of appropriateness does not entail the occurrence of a process of considering this criterion.

    The crucial objection to the intellectualist legend is this. The consideration of propositions is itself an operation the execution of which can be more or less intelligent, less or more stupid. But if, for any operation to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical operation had first to be performed and performed intelligently, it would be a logical impossibility for anyone ever to break into the circle.</blockquote>
--Ryle, The Concept of Man

Is <em>thought</em> an action? Thought represents a certain state of affairs with objective particulars. But if thought is an action, then the act of one's thinking is subject to the conditions of thought. Thus, one's {act of thinking} can be represented in the thought, but who's thought? If in the agent who is performing the (pseudo-)act, then the agent will have to consider itself as an "object as constituent of the proposition of thought." Thus, the "rational agent" in the thought will be the self-as-projected into the proposition. But nevertheless, the act of projecting one's self will need to be preceded by the act of the act of projecting one's self as possessing the thought. And so on.

To consider each act has presupposing a thought, then, seems to be grossly false. Thus, some acts, interpreted intelligent or otherwise, do not presuppose, or bear as antecedent, a thought. But my question goes further: Is thought itself an action? Must we consider <em>thought</em> in itself an action qua an event. That is, the thought is some event which is describable under a certain linguistic scheme, physical or mental. Is the thought an action with a history of physical descriptions or mental descriptions? Ryle assumes, perhaps reasonably, that thought is an "internal act." But whereas outward, or external, acts are describable by external agents, who is to "describe" these internal acts? If the act is by definition internal, why would external agents have access to it? But in order to be an act, must this act be in some real sense "external" by definition? Does Ryle mean "event" when he says "act"? What would a "thought event" look like? Is this question presupposing that "thought events" are "thought acts" in that "thought events" have a particular qualitative nature?

All this, I think, allows us to suggest that to say "thought as action" precedes action really only means "action precedes action" or that "action presupposes action." That is, if the criteria for action is {X,Y,Z}, then if the thought necessarily extends no further than that criteria, it may well be called an action. If we are forced to consider "thought" as action, then to posit that action, intelligent say, leaves us still to inquire: "Was it an intelligent or unintelligent thought that preceded that intelligent action?

Unintelligent thought > Intelligent action

The consequent is <em>interpreted</em> as such.

Intelligent thought > Intelligent action

Is the consequent interpreted? How might we conclude that the intelligent action actually followed from an intelligent thought? Any thought at all? We might assume that all thought, given a certain degree of rationality as axiom, is intelligent. This is only to say, there is a reason behind the action.

Unintelligent thought > Unintelligent action

Is an unintelligent thought a non-thought? We might say that a thought completely stupid is not a thought at all.

Intelligent thought > Unintelligent action

A reason given--Will it still strike us as a "reason" if the action does not correspond to it in the way intelligent way?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The witty may have their way, but if we wish to speak of <em>truth</em>, will we be so quick to say that its obtainment <em>must </em>follow <em>this </em>procedure?

Naturally, there's a commendable kind of "cleverness" and there's a crude kind of "clever" that is more akin to a vice than a virtue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We will call an action free that is the unimpeded action of a cognizant agent. When I get out of bed in the morning to brush my teeth, nothing impedes this action of mine. Thus, it is a free action. My willing it to be the case met no obstacle, no prevention that would lead to it not being the case.

Willing as magnitude of desire to obtain a particular state of affairs is unmeasurable in principle.

Transcendental free will depends on this example: I necessarily will that such-and-such be the case (that I obtain such-and-such). However, this is incoherent. Further, it allows us to view all states of affairs as valid objects of willing (an intentional operator). For example, I will that I drink a glass of orange juice. We can easily imagine this free action, so long as I am not prevented from obtaining the state of affairs wherein I drink a glass of orange juice. However, I will that I will in such-and-such a way. Can my own faculty of willing be the object of my will? my imagination? What is the background which constitutes my willing one faculty over another? How might I judge one faculty of willing to another faculty? Further, as the phenomenologist might argue, it seems that willing in itself presupposes an intentional object. But what might we allow this intentional object to be? What permits it to have the status of "object"? Must an object always possess a clear and distinct contrast-class in order to be presented as such within the proposition?

Consciousness always possesses an object is the claim of the phenomenologist. Consciousness has the property of intentionality, or aboutness. The conscious mind must always possess an object to which it reflects on in some particular way or is considering in some particular way (I believe that X, I hope that Y).

I will that my willing be different. Different in what way? How can one's faculty be chosen over another? Must an object such as this be "concrete"? Does its lacking concreteness prevent it from being captured in a propositional attitude? This seems unlikely, for God can be the object of a proposition. But can it really?

What is the dividing line between the abstract and the concrete?

Free will is a concept which involves necessity. Perhaps "I necessarily will that" is incorrect. It more so suggests the form "I will that X is necessarily the case." However, freedom--the kind of freedom I argue for--suggests only that "I will that X is possibly the case" is coherent, is a coherent understanding of "freedom." Does it preclude any notion of "necessary free will"?

But is obtaining through choice of this faculty of desire, or choosing, rather than another a case, a particular state of affairs? My choosing this lemon rather than that lime is a state of affairs, wherein I am standing holding a lemon rather than a lime. But what of my own faculty? Must a faculty, once chosen, look a particular way? Or is it a "private case" or state of affairs that transpires in my mind? Again, what might such a transaction look like?

Necessity and freedom meet at the limit of possibility. What freedom fades completely is that freedom which is conceived to be beyond the limit of possibility. Contingent freedom tests the limit of possibility.  Necessary freedom is that freedom which strikes no one as having a questionable possibility. Actions occurring under this kind of necessity are the freest of all actions; they show us truly what "free will" indeed is as a true concept. However, this actions are mundane and trivial to most, such as walking to and from the kitchen or raising one's own hand.

These free actions are not refuted by counterclaims of cultural conditioning. But what of neurological "tricking" or scientific brain "triggering"? Are these actions free if a scientist <em>forces </em>them? Well, your answer lies in your question. But if you <em>belief</em> them to be your own? Again, does this show that all my actions are not free? Should we look at the context in which free action occurs? Do we mean <em>ceteris paribus</em> I am free? What does "ceteris paribus" define as the domain in which free actions occur and in which they <em>only </em>can be described as free?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>I shall begin by noting two points. First, in that sense of 'justified' in which S's being justified in believing P is a necessary condition of S's knowing that P, <em>it is possible for a person to be justified in believing a proposition that is in fact false</em>. Secondly, for any proposition P, if S is justified in believing P, and P entails Q, and S deduces Q from P and accepts Q as a result of this deduction, then S is justified in believing Q. Keeping these two points in mind, I shall now present two cases in which the conditions stated in (a) are true for some proposition, though it is at the same time false that the person in question knows that proposition.</blockquote>
--<em>Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?</em>, Edmund Gettier

I: Jones did not in fact get the job. False premise. Smith cannot be expected to infer a truth from an indeterminate premise. Well, this depends: Would Smith sincerely assent to "p" as Jones will get the job? If he sincerely assents to p, then he believes that p. But no one would admit that it's <em>necessarily true</em> that p, and Smith especially would not.

II: Same with Jones. Is it necessarily true that Jones owns a Ford?

Can we believe necessary truths? Are they relevant? Again: Are they about the world? If they are not, then they cannot be used to combat the Gettier problem(s).

Closer to being analytically true: "{The getter of the job} who [will get the job] (will have ten coins in his pocket)."

We can generalize to this, using existential generalization.

"{The getter of the job} who [is a man] (will have ten coins in his pocket)."

"The man" is being predicated with "getting the job." 
"The getter of the job" is being predicated with "being a man."

The obvious and commonsense objection, of course, is that "existential generalization does not permit any decision-procedure, in itself, for picking out <em>which</em> token. "The man" = "Some man" or "A man" or "At least one man."

If we take Russellian interpretation, we'll have a definition description.

There exists one and only one unique man who will get the job who will also have ten coins in his pocket. If we take "uniqueness" to mean "just one, having a consistent set of properties where at least one property is possessed that no other object possesses" and not "<em>this</em> particular guy" then we have the same problem. We have perhaps highlighted two interpretations of uniqueness. Should we prefer one over the other? Does the former interpretation of uniqueness presuppose the latter? Can we pick out from the latter interpretation if the former is not true of the object we intend to pick out? Is the dichotomy justified? Are they in fact narrower/broader interpretations of uniqueness?

But it's nevertheless true if we accept the existential generalization without having to actually show which man (decide upon) we mean. There is in fact some man who satisfies both predicates; that man just turns out to be the man Smith did not have knowledge of. But again, can Smith be faulted not being able to do exactly what cannot be done with an existential generalization? Or can it be done?

If Smith sees his generalization, he will say, "Ah yes, I did not know because I was thinking of Jones the entire time."

Do logical inferences remove us from the world? Would Smith say to himself? Yes, I accept the inference, but I realize now that I am no longer talking about the world. I have removed myself to the level of termplay; my evidence is a logical rule. Naturally, Gettier wishes us to accept his equivocation for evidence. He explicitly appeals to it in the quote given. However, "logical evidence" and "experiential evidence" need to be looked at closer.

For JTB, "has adequate evidence for" not only equivocates "evidence." It equivocates "adequacy." How adequate will we say a logical inference is? Well, we cannot argue with logical inferences save we wish to attack the whole of a logical system (especially if we're attacking Modus Ponens; what a dare!). But experiential evidence? Can we attack this kind of evidence on the same basis? What is the true relation between the logically adequate and the experientially adequate?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Shoutout to highschool agnosticism (postmodernism)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Anything is possible" requires clarification. Further, as with anyone who takes agnosticism, one can always counter <em>How do you know this</em>?

<strong>For example:</strong>
1 How do you know God is not knowable?

2 How do you know that you don't/can't know?

3 How do you come to know that anything is possible? (How far does your agnosticism go? All the way to radical skepticism about knowledge? How did you come to know that no one knows anything? How do you come to know that all evidence is inadequate evidence? How do you come to know that no fact can be known? How do you know that no fact can come to be believed? Some people do believe things, and you have beliefs: Which believes are not known, and how do you know that they cannot be/are not known?)

4 What about things you cannot conceive or that are not humanly conceivable? Are those things possible? (Such as squared circles doing your math homework.)

"Anything is possible" as a premise is a contradiction in terms (which is the worst kind of contradiction).

"Anything" in "Anything is possible" admits nonpossibilities (to interpret it otherwise would mean you are revising your premise of "anything is possible" to mean something other than its standard meaning). Thus, "a nonpossibility is possible" becomes a statement that, by generalization and given your premise, you must accept as true. "Anything is possible" is in fact in contradiction to agnosticism. 

An agnostic cannot permit the claim that anything is possible because the agnostic would have to at the same time admit that he does not know that any particular thing is possible. The agnostic would, in effect, be asserting a straightforwardly vacuous claim.

Understand what I challenge, however. If one mean "anything is possible" in its idiomatic sense, then fine. But surely, I have not accepted nor is it possible for me to actually understand what has been said. If one means the y'know-what-I-mean sense of "anything is possible," then I can surely say "No, I do not know what you mean.”

If "anything is possible" carries the disclaimer "so long as you understand what I mean," then one must explain what one means. At this point "anything is possible" is not something that can be affirmed or denied. It's a placeholder for a more specific thought. In the context of philosophical discussion, however, at such a level of abstraction, "anything is possible" literally means nothing.

For instance, if we argue about cars and engine troubles. If one says "anything is possible" mid-conversation, as we're talking about a particular subject, I know what is meant. Surely one does not mean "Baseball bats can spell my name backwards on Sundays at 3PM if you pray for them to do so" or "God is wearing my underpants." I realize we're talking about cars. So one means "anything is possible within the context of our subject matter with more or less a degree of breathing room for unlikely scenarios." It means that the most unlikely scenarios still have a degree of probability that we ought not cast aside too rashly.

But in the realm of metaphysics and high level argument (especially concerning free will/determinism), "anything is possible" means almost nothing at all (given that our topic is already so abstract and general to begin with).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3155/3084247580_b319334335.jpg' alt='Tragically Optimistic Zombie'/>

First draft, to the right. That's some kind of strange self-portrait on the left.

Now that dialogue (on its face it looks like diagogue) is beyond me. I distinctly remember not talking to anyone during that class, yet I seem to be responding to something.

The zombie character will be named &quot;Chalmers,&quot; and the maggot will take the appellation &quot;Willard.&quot; The comic, should it come into existence, will center on the humor in applying conceptual analysis to everyday states of affairs, tragic ironies befalling the protagonist, sucker punches to analytic philosophy, Office Space-esque situation humor, general cynicism, hyperliteralism, debased wordplay, a brand of absurdism/nonsequiturism, and conceptual incoherence. (Pretty heft plate; easier said than done!) 

(Nonetheless,) it may become a comic, but that highly depends on my willingness to artistically refine the character drawings, straight-jacket my view on humor, find the time, etc.

A friend (Trey, writer at tofu (poetry) and I originally conceived the idea around summertime. I forget how much of it is his and how much of it is mine. It largely sprouted out of our philosophical banter and snide remarks toward various philosophical theories.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ethos, Ethics, Morals, etc.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ethics (ethos) is a broader concept than morals. For the nonphilosopher, an "ethic" should refer to a set of moral principles. But in our contemporary vernacular, it has become an idiomatic mode of expression to use "ethics" and "morals" interchangeably. So perhaps it was not fitting to have the article title highlight a philosophical distinction whereas the article itself does not make that distinction. 

For philosophers, ethics, of course, is distinctly contrasted with morals, as ethics is the study of ethical systems which are just comprised of moral principles. The ethical system itself provides the axioms and broad definitions, in most cases, which form the basis of each moral principle therein. The moral principles, in effect, get their "justification" from the broad ethical notions given in the system. The ethical axioms and definitions are not themselves "moral." The behavior, actions, persons to which those ethical notions are used as justification for moral claims are rightly described as "moral," "right," "wrong," etc.

I suppose in another way of speaking, an ethic is simple "the set of moral principles we commonly see manifest in a culture." This way of referring to ethics, perhaps, may be used so as to not presuppose that a discussion of the definitions and axioms must be referred to as well. For instance, the Ten Commandments are a set of moral principles. "The Ten Commandments" is the name of the ethical system. All that which goes into those Ten Commandments as justification (God's goodness, God's spirit therein the authors, revelation of God, the notion of miracles) for the moral principles are the definitions and axioms. Again, for instance, we can see a miracle as either  a morally righteous or morally depraved. Thus, a miracle itself is not a morale principle. The notion of it alone acts as a justification for certain moral principles. So, "honor thy father and thy mother" is justified by the "miracle of life" and the "divine chain from Father unto father." Life in itself cannot be properly described as "good" because the semantic notion of "good" presupposes that a thing be "good for" something. This is why we're constantly in search of purpose for ourselves. The divine chain cannot be described as "good" because we are unable to discern what the chain, in itself, is ultimately good for.

"Good" seems ultimately wrapped up in teleology. So it seems, then, that moral principles are involved with teleology. Ethical systems, though closely related to moral principles, do not necessarily involve teleology. In the end, it's difficult to see their value and further their difference since ethical systems are usually judged by their moral principles (which we view as largely teleological in nature). So, we quickly infer from the concrete nature of moral principles, that the ethical systems which countenance them so too must be teleological. However, this is not necessarily so. Ethical systems are more abstract than concrete, less concerned with enabling us to say "what" is good and more concerned with enabling us to say "why" what we say is "good" is "in fact" good, justifying our appellations of goodness.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I <em>know </em>that I am in pain.

What is a conception of knowledge? What is a popular conception of knowledge? What are the conditions that one must satisfy in order to be described as knowing that a proposition is true. Is "I am in pain" a proposition? Can it stand alone in the paper with no true subject?

I believe that I am in pain.
"I am in pain" is a true statement about the world.
I have adequate justification for believing that I am in pain.

What is a "justification"? To whom shall this justification be directed? Suppose that I interpret my pain. What might an interpretation presuppose? "Namely that alternative interpretations are available to you."

Yes, but what is presupposed by "alternative interpretation"? <em>Must</em> alternative interpretation presuppose alternative agents to whom advance those interpretations? When I interpret this piece of art, I immediately show a part of myself in my offering. "But you will doubt yourself. You may doubt that your interpretation is correct." So, we must conclude, that there is no "correct interpretation." Am I correct in justifying that I am in pain if there are infinite interpretations? (I will follow the rule as a skeptic: <em>That</em> interpretation is doubtful, etc.)

Is an interpretation correct or is it an end? We say, "You are certainly right!" What does this mean? Is it that we have been convinced of our falsity? or is it that we have become too tired to argued but unaware of our fatigue. The limit of a mind may be reached before it enters that mind's intentional space.

When I represent my subjective self as object, there is no picture of the self available. It is an object which matches the form of its Subject. Wherein lies the justification of pain? Am I in debate with my inner homunculus; is <em>he</em> convinced of that justification, that interpretation of the case?

Does "justification" presuppose the falsity of solipism? If every interpretation is beneath my own, then I must understand how interpretation is a possible. Why must I justify myself to empty skulls?

By what criteria might I judge the adequate from the inadequate?

If I must justify my moral appellation, I must configure the whole world to my liking to make that moral judgment true. The world confirms to every moral proposition. Seek to the world as such to show that the moral proposition has any truth condition whatsoever. (<em>Avec le proposition morale vient le monde</em>.)

I might know that A = A.
I might not know that A=A.
I might know that A =/= A.
I might not know that A =/= A.

I might know that 2+2=4.
I might not know that 2+2=4.
I might know that 2+2=5.
I might not know that 2+2=5.

I might know that the book is inside the box.
I might not know that the book is inside the box.
I might know that the book is not inside the box.
I might not know that the book is not inside the box.

I might know that I am in pain.
I might not know that I am in pain.
I might know that I am not in pain.
I might not know that I am not in pain.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The strength of metaphor: its inability to countenance a literal attitude. The beauty of metaphor follows from that it absconds any set. The set is antithesis to the metaphor.

Is rationality possible because metaphor is possible? Does the persistence of the metaphor establish indefinitely our philosophical nemesis: dualism. But we call ourselves property dualists, anomalous monists!

Is the denial of the possibility metaphor a denial of rationality? Does the metaphor die with physicalism? Any form of monism?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Common sense tells us that our pains are located in physical space within our bodies, that for example, a pain in the foot is literally inside the area of the foot. But we now know that is false. The brain forms a body image and pains, like all bodily sensations, are part of the body image. The <em>pain-in-the-foot is literally in the physical space of the brain</em>. [Searle, J., The Rediscovery of the Mind, 1992: p. 63.]</blockquote>

Are you kidding me?! I almost vomited-and-had-an-aneurysm-in-the-physical-space-of-my-mouth. I'm shaking uncontrollably, painfully...

How might "The pain I experience from reading analytic philosophy journal articles" given this line of thinking? Even if we accept such an philosophically ungrammatical premise, are we to, by extension, conclude that <em>pain felt from reading analytic philosophy</em> is thing located in space and time <em>in the same way</em> that my foot is located in space and time?

One grammar has got to give! And <em>the other</em> cannot be given bootstraps of any kind!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 That we call it "artificial" seems to be a misnomer. What we mean is artefactual, but we apply this terminology so as to elevate our own status. That is was created. However, our true intention is to suggest that such an intelligence is derivative. We are dealing with derivative intelligence, in that such an intelligence, should it be considered intelligence at all, follows from our being fundamentally related to it in some way. That way consists of its intelligence depending on our own.

2 But we should not wish to call such an intelligence just that, namely intelligence, which is why we call it artificial, fake, etc. But what is the relation of derivative intelligence to rule following? Might a derived intelligence interpret a rule? Do we use "rule" in an equivocal way when we suggest that the derived intelligence is following rules? Do we in fact mean "following input"? Can a derived intelligence interpret a rule? What is an interpretation? Is it indeed "the expression of a rule"? Derived intelligence has no use for interpretation of a rule; it cannot <em>see </em>interpretation of a rule for it does not understand that its following a rule <em>is </em>an interpretation of it. Derived intelligence does not express the rule; it neither stands in accordance or in disagreement with it.

3 A derived intelligence does not compute. Does it make sense to say that a derived intelligence has symbols? Is a finite sequence of binary digits a symbol? Can this intelligence realize that "finite sequence" is indeed what it is processing? Are there "finite sequences" at the most basic level of this intelligence? Is such a concept, "finite sequence," a criterion for intelligence? A criterion for "understanding a symbol"? Is a symbol a finite-object? In what ways might it be called one? A derived intelligence seems to satisfy a <em>treatment</em> criterion for symbolism. Binary sequences are treated <em>as if</em> they are symbols. At higher levels of operation, the derived intelligence processes not the binary sequence but the encapsulated variable. A higher level language may compute the binary sequence, but the symbol (encoded variable) means nothing to the processor or to the video memory or to the monitor screen. However, the principle still remains: higher level software is replaceable other softwares; this is not so for the human whole or human brain.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In some ways, the concept of money requires ignorance between buyer and seller. However, with the way we complain about "accountability" and "consumer awareness," that "division of labor" is becoming clearer and clearer. Thus, our ignorance is being slowly removed.

What is the power of money? We typically do not question the journey each dollar in our pocket book takes. But is this tendency to not question what really countenances the division of labor? Are we divided only because we are ignorant?

It would seem that this tendency for accountability presupposes that we understand each person's role in society. In effect, demanding accountability demands that the people have power over the big car companies, banks, the market. Essentially, we want to be able to tell those divided that their planning, their models, etc are poor plans, poor models. We do not want to perform their labor; we want more; we want to ability to decide how their labor operates by constraining them to monetary accountability. So the division of labor becomes clear, but the division of power becomes less divided. Control becomes more unified.

How can I hold a banker accountable when that banker can simply say, "You do not understand the complexity of my work, the interest models, the loan models?" It seems that we are divided in our labor because we've had a proclivity to accept ignorance. What is the limit of my understanding the world of a banker? It would seem my limit here shows the limit of communism. 

This "accountability" issue is in opposition to "accepting ignorance."

It seems that "accountability" is a tenet closer to communist economics. "You might produce your information, but it belongs to us all so that we can each make rational decision, dictate the next whim of the market." Accountability is deleterious to capitalist economics.]]></content:encoded>

The doubt of the hammer mangles and tangles
Us into our human form; and we continue,--
How we continue so, we know, we know

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now that Cartesian dualism is behind us (or so they say), we're left with all kinds of property dualism (with identity theses) and wild reductionism. I'm reading "Strangers to Ourselves" and the author claims that our "... it [adaptive unconscious] feels." But does he really claim this? First, it's a popular psychology book (not in the pejorative sense). It seems that he's aiming for something idiomatic, not aiming to ascribe conscious properties (of the whole human) to some one of its parts. He later claims "it generates those feelings." Clearly, if taken literally, these two claims say very different things. The former is a philosophically ungrammatical misascription and the latter is a vacuous scientific statement.

But does the author even maintain such a thesis, that brains <em>feel</em> and one's unconscious loves his daughter more than <em>he</em>? I think much of this debate springs out of authors want to sound punchy or idiomatic or to sell books. It's alluring (to the science buffs) and captivating to think that your brain can do potentially all or most of what you do in your waking hours. Scientists take a grammatico-conceptual shorthand, which is likely <em>the</em> problem of the philosophy of mind.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A past time of mine is to read a philosophical text aloud to myself, as powerfully and with as much urgency as I can muster. It is exciting to read the greats as though I was performing before an audience. Whilst reading Ayer's assault on religious knowledge (though the avenue of religious language) I realized that I engage in this activity quite often. Where I see a poetry reading, I imagine a philosophy reading.

This brings a markedly human quality to the austere and distant melodies of systematically placed premises, definitions, statements. These be notes to the sheet; syllogisms are the chords of communication.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The World as Event</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 The world is a multiplicity of event. Wherein the world one perceives the event, thereof one deduces that the event is prior to itself within a medium which simplifies it. The extent to which the event may come into the world at all is the extent to which that event may be expressed. To deduce, to apply the a priori, is not to engage in the thought but to express what must be expressed of the event.
1.1 The event is simple. There exist no objects outside of the event. The event cannot be rightly understood as an object.
1.2 We are wont to say, now, that the event, so described, is a human description. We feign the notion of causation. We declare what is cause and what is effect to the extent that it pleases us. What does not please us is analytic and what does please us synthetic.
1.3 What does it mean "to please" in this sense? Earlier our kin called it "satisfaction." This satisfies this. We bemoan that either the former or the latter must maintain at a "higher" level.
1.4 Why do we speak of foundations and levels? We reject coherence for it implies relativism of some sort. We claim that correspondence is the method, for there must be something that corresponds. 
1.5 The world has no object that corresponds to anything whatever.
1.6 The world is composed of the event. 
1.7 Each event of the world plays a part in a picture. And the world is mistaken for a picture. We argue that question must be meaningful. What is presupposed by a meaningful question? A model rests underneath the question, soaked in the filth of one's method. We contrive method for we feel that the answer is best understood by a method. "What kind of question do you have for me?"--I have your answer, but you must suffer my method.
1.8 And the event; what does it presuppose? The event, so it is claimed, must be intelligible. Or else it is not an event. In speaking, not referring, there is an event. The event travels well within the discourse of science, and so to does it carry on in the discourse of conversation. "The belief is a cause so long as you understand me." How might we go about understanding you? Here, I have reset the game. Meaning, if it is not grasped at first blush, is lost. Interpretation is the void of all reality. If you interpret, you do not "create" or "destroy," but you become inert.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a poem; on the other hand,
Read this as poem or as a text--what?
How might I judge this poem? And:
How will I cut its markings into symbols

Grasp all the symbols, discriminate them
Into logical types that fit or do not
Fit every claim into a container of virtuous
Sense willing to bankrupt the gutters of Minds

And refer to antipodals, building empty totals
To tell me just how human I am, Where
Can we escape into those worlds between
These dichotomous dialogues of wasted time

Speak carefully the hubris of your craft,
The craft of your living shall drain the integrity
Of every shoe you smell,--Then! Find God
Before the swollen step stumbling--interminably]]></content:encoded>

To pendulums droning dimpled empty tones tanning
But bastard bellows from angry man tremble terrible
Tremors to turpentine tethers teem together ten tows

Shackles onto those unto whom and wrought whom hampered
Hagglers flake and share numerical banter before formless
Abstractions of bounded minds, masters meticulous to their ends

Often rhythms oft-shot to shambles by careful claims mistaken

		<title>A test of legal positivism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"What they are saying is that if you pull someone out of a pool, if you provide CPR, you do have a defense," said Torti's lawyer, Jody Steinberg. "It seems to defy logic," he said. "At a certain point anyone who instructs or educates [in emergencies] will advise that you must hesitate. Those split-second decisions will be gone and someone could die." 
--<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=6498405&page=1">Woman Sued for Rescue Effort in Car Crash</a></blockquote>

Should we modify our Good Samaritan laws because of this case? Should we generally constrain the concept of intending to help to the concept of capacity to properly administer aid? Should people generally be held responsible for helping others, rather than being held responsible only for what positive consequences come from their actions? Seems like a one way street here. When we satisfy others with our help, we're thought to be heroes and largely responsible for our actions. But our Good Samaritan "intuitions" suggest that when we act poorly, we are not responsible. Here, "intending to help" is meant to justify any action taken, for better or ill. Our Good Samaritan "intuitions" seem to function on a biased premise.

When we help others, we receive no legal benefits. Why should we be susceptible to legal detriments? Seems like a one way street to me. Here again, our legal system, though it utilizes the Good Samaritan principle, conflicts with our "intuitions." It does not reward those who help satisfactorily, but it's possible to punish those who help erroneously and clumsily. Does our intuition consider that help gone awry is deserving of punishment?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"I believe that God does not exist. Wait, wait, before you reject my claim. This is what I mean by 'God'--how God makes sense to me. God is my toaster, and it blew a fuse yesterday. Therefore, God does not exist."</blockquote>

All hail the Subjective. It justifies all.

<em>Is God-as-big-brother just one's feeble attempt to draw a square circle?</em>

If so, atheists, who justify religious belief on psychological grounds, justify what? The justification is logically untenable. But <em>why</em> do atheists (a) justify such a thing (b) by such a procedure? What is the atheist afraid of? This psychological comfort justification sounds frighteningly similar to the claim that "Well, you'll come 'round to understanding God when you're older." This is the kind of nonsense the familial Christian stands upon as he speaks to his fallen kin. But the question is not <em>Is he, indeed, standing</em>? The question, of course, is <em>Why does he think that he is standing?</em>

These are the questions with which I grapple. I seem not to be able to overcome them. Each that-clause presupposes a context, and that context itself presupposes another. Does the questioning end whence the answer is concerned with what, if anything, is said to be the Thought. Is the atheist thinking? Are we licensed to infer the assertoric on basis of (presumed) cultural problematic? Or does "the world" carry on apodeictic?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Moral absolutists (Fundies, the Moral Right, my grandparents, old fogies, hyperdogmatists, pro-lifers (meaning "anti-abortionists")) are just silly! They're unable to see the "gray area" in reality!</blockquote>
--the PoMo, the "Atheist/Agnostic", the Relativist, the Rationalist, the Enlightened, the Philosopher
(The quotes <em>are</em> placed with purpose and precision.)

<strong>Gloss: </strong>Moral absolutism ain't the problem, it's moral realism. It's the mistaken belief that we can talk about morality like we talk about (scientific) factual matters (first). And (second) that we can talk about those moral (factual) matters like they're subject to truth-and-falsity.

The problem is that most, if not all, people think there are moral facts <em>at all</em> rather than moral facts <em>they can be (absolutely) right or wrong about</em>. The problem is that these people treat "right" and "wrong" like they're semantically similar to "true" and "false."

They're wrong.

The problems cause is likely due to the problematic demarcation between <em>talking about</em> a topic and being involved with <em>reference.</em> When one refers, one thinks there is a definite, determinate, demonstrable object to be the referent, whereas when one ("merely") talks about a subject, one is attempting to communicate a different definite object, an object that <em>is</em> the attempt at communication. The semantic value is not <em>in </em>the proposition, if there be any proposition at all, but it floats above it. Perhaps it is pragmatic, in that the context is the criterion for a "truth-value," if it's intelligible to talk about truth-value or anything like them as standing outside of the boundaries of "the proposition."

There are no moral facts to be "relative" to a culture unless when one is speaking descriptively; that is to say, speaking <em>about </em>the cultural <em>from behind </em>the cloak of anthropology, where science <em>belongs.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A child sits solemnly between himself and his masterpiece,
Between him and his covers and sheets,
Between his and Him who creeps sadly by summers
Are mornings of the year, refreshed bad noondays grumble
Discontent his mind scatters seven years of tumult
Across the cycle before an empty viewport, a window into
Stables, the stable of living--eat hay, shit spans the walls
And the stink carries over, under, through, there, then to
My stall; I can't worry this form that this form that this form

Because the deity fondles the mind so long, 'til gone all passions
Of love and life; and you cannot escape to amateur philosophy,
Is what we're all groping, that tricky sort of game riddled with
Riddles on riddles on fuck's sake end this line or I'll scream
'Til beams of hope perforce force forcing--we've bleed us,
And our language, to the last vein stamped and sealed in
The cold sweat of our industrious truth that we stifle with lying
There play with care, boy, the god you whimper to is drenched
In alcohol and fists, and Legos measure the width of culture]]></content:encoded>

And then we find that verse supposed to start us off,--
I said I found it: We're talking about love. That period
Signifies that I've made a point, and another one will come
Like the desperate man, whore, fucking every thought

Where do we begin our Selves; this preliminary study is going

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The distinction to be made: between "maps" and "mappings". All to often we are strongarmed into having to accept the pragmatic principle: if scientific models adequately explain the behavior of the thing in question (in this case, the behavior of rational agents), then that scientific model is valid. Thus, adequacy and validity take on an intimate relationship. But this is [i]not[/i] the problematic we are concerned with. The problem is not that science is or is not steered in the direction of some satisfactory end. It is that science is not at the wheel, period. When we call something a "mapping," this is not at the same time to call it a "map." The neuroscientist is quick to claim that the brain utilizes a representation (a map), a representational map, in its interpretation of the world. What follows is that it, the brain, conveys to us our behavior to which it, the brain, is the necessary governor. But in calling a thing a "mapping" we are in fact describing a correlation between a two sets of entities. We say correctly that the brain follows a certain mapping, generated by induction generalization (and essentially an approximation). More specifically, the neurons themselves behave according to the approximated geography that we inductively produce. But it is incoherent to go further to say that the neurons themselves in fact utilize that precise <em>map </em>that we call the result of our concluded <em>mappings</em>.

We are not claiming that inferences cannot be validly (adequately) made based on our neural-mappings and correlations. We are disturbed by the fact that the neuroscientist says more than what can be said, extends the sense of the term brain or neuron to include to utilization of maps. If the procedure of inductive mapping depends on the (scientifico-theoretical) premise that the brain itself utilizes the map, then we, of course, have an incoherency. Further, no empirical evidence will show that the brain indeed does utilize a map, since the concepts themselves are separated from their usual, correct and conventional senses.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ramblings on Determinism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So my prof in class to-day was carrying on about the Kant and his transcendental idealism. Somewhere along the road, he introduces, in a rather dry and simplistic manner, as the roads of philosophy often can be, a bunch of the distinctions we all know and love: analytic-synthetic, 
a priori-a posteriori, 
necessity-contingency, 
phenomena-noumena.

Once we got to the latter, we glanced at the free will and determinism "debate." The prof asked if anyone could explicate exactly what the central (opposing) positions are. This being a <em>history</em> of philosophy class, I knew to keep my mouth shut. But here, I will propose perhaps a traditional argument which suggests that one must be clear on what one means by "determinism" before one argues that there is something to which our common notion of "free will" is opposed.

Hume's skeptical view is that we cannot logically infer a future state of affairs because alls we've got is paststuff. The past is logically distinct from the future. Thus, in order to have any hope of probability, the premises to your claim about the future must contain some assumption about the future. What gives you the power of predictability is the assumption which supports your claim about the future. Premises, to put it roughly, can consist of "evidence" and "assumptions." Where "evidence" is more or less agreed "fact" and "assumption" is, relative to the future, categorized in the same way as your evidence. Assumptions are not "past" or "future" objects. They're judgments of some sort, based on facts (your evidence); they're <em>about</em> the past or the future. 

Determinism has a lot to do with "evidence" and interpretation of that evidence. A "hard determinist" cannot infer (necessarily, logically) that someone ought to do such-and-such, unless the determinist has given convincing argument for her (assumption-)premise. All one can do as a determinist is intepret and make probabilistic claims about what one <em>is likely to do</em>, within the framework of logical possibility. Becoming a dragon on Sunday is highly improbable but still possible, given that we come to terms on what the criteria for Dragonhood is, etc etc. In any case, my point is that there is no "debate" between determinism and the free willer; further, there's no point to qualifying oneself as a "(in)compatibilist." There is no "hard determinism", for one blunt reason (that requires elucidation, I know) that "freedom," "free will," etc insofar as the concept has a conventional use in our language. Hard determinism is incoherent with compared with our normal linguistic practices. But that's really beside my point. To argue that determinism gets off the ground, the determinist must answer the Humean skeptic.

So we must ask ourselves, "How is a claim about the future similar to a moral claim?" But first, given that one must make a choice between a finite set of so-and-sos, what does the determinist actually say? "It is logically necessary that you will choose Y" or "By the rules of logic, you must choose X". But what is "must" doing in this statement? If it follows necessarily that I shall choose Y, then why on earth do I need science (which is just a collection of scientists) to tell me this? It's logically certain! Science does not deal with metaphysical necessity, lest it wish to dress itself in the metaphysician's robe. What has one told me by highlighting causal laws which do not flow necessarily?

The scientist certainly does not wish to advance such a thesis--bleh, give.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A friend of mind asked me, out of the blue (which is the best setting for doing philosophy), for essentially what the private language (counter)argument is. I failed miserably then, but I should like to say some things about it now.

In doing philosophy, when we are often confronted with a kind of doubt which presumes to ask a legitimate question where in fact one is being illogical in one's use of the terms of that question; and more often than not <em>sincerity</em> and <em>earnestness</em> is the only foundation on which that question rests. Its grammar is wanting of a grounding in which to have sense. The private language argument is a reminder of the way in which language can coherently function. It is not, so much, an etymological bully nor is it too restrictive (for science or for arts). Anyway, this latter argument isn't really an argument, and how I tire of evaluations masked in the logical form of our trade.

We must first ask ourselves: What kind of <em>mistake</em> did Descartes make? What does it mean, for instance, for us to have "foundational beliefs" or "principle beliefs" or "basic beliefs"? Where does our French thinker get off talking about the whole, and not just from his station of being a part, but where does he simply get off <em>talking about the whole</em>? The argument is not: Descartes thinks so highly of human cognition, so as to find a place at the feet of God. It is rather: What in God's name <em>is he talking about</em>? The distinction between a waking world and a dream world? "<em>Worlds</em>"?

Is it that we accept a <em>way of talking</em> as a basis for our drawing inferences? "Mind your business" in some strange way acts as fodder to the cognitive neuroscientist. Indeed, it <em>is</em> fodder. How strange is that! Where the idiom seems more interested in defeating itself than being a vessel for communication. As if to say: We are speaking here, now, as only potential evidence for our own intention to mean a nonsense! We are simply talking ourselves into our own graves, shoveling our pit for our imminent entrapment.

But the private language argument is this: The name has a certain domain that produces nonsense for inputs called "sensations." What you draw inferences from is a mystery because your source is undefined. A naming cannot map to a sensation in the same way that a naming maps to public objects.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We discussed John Austin and his notion of positive law, (not quite positive morality,) and sovereignty.

I haven't touched the text, but the prof read Austin's definition of sovereignty from it. And we discussed it.

A (political) sovereign is one who is habitually obeyed and who does not habitually obey another. At first, it sounds as if Austin is going on about some metaphysical account of "sovereignty." But perhaps I should call it "numerical sovereignty." As if to say, "9 is habitually followed by 10 but habitually follows 8" and then the next move is to say, "9, <em>so to speak, </em>is our (national) political sovereign." But more strictly he means by this that entity who produces law. We covered command, law, duty, sanction. Duty is understood as being predicated on or made possible by its corresponding sanctions. There is no duty without a fitting sanction of some sort.

Austin is concerned with a specific kind of "command," and duties are predicated on the kind of command which has a possible rule-like nature. Isolated commands like "do your homework" are not laws, whereas "if you have homework, do it" is. Command as law, then, has the nature of being a hypothetical imperative. As a legal positivist, Austin holds that a (law-like) command begins, or find its origin, in entities like us, humans (as opposed to being dictates from God, etc).

The interesting part of the class came when we were given the definition of "sovereignty." When it's definition was written on the whiteboard, I immediately expected some backlash. I waited for someone, anyone, to say something. It felt a deep sadness as the minutes passed. Eventually, a student highlighted the fact that, for instance, in our manifestation of representative democracy, our President obeys "we, the People." Thus, our President is not our political sovereign; indeed, we are! However, I do not actually think this student was making <em>that</em> argument.

I think she, in fact, was highlighting a vagueness of the term "obey," or she was making the point, "What does it mean to be obedient?" I doubt she was making the naïve view to which everyone in this country immediately scoffs at. However, for a philosophy class, I found it surprising that a <em>scoff</em> should even occur. Later on, I attempted to attack the intuition that such a view is prime facie "naïve." Nevertheless, I suppose such an evaluation is about all the argument you will get. Laden are we in the filth of shoddy government, so much so that we presume it <em>wise</em> not to think but rather to squirm with discontent.

But perhaps I am too charitable to this student's attempt. What I suspect she was getting at is that, based on Austin's definition, we can draw the kind of inference that <em>is</em> just <em>that</em> argument, that argument to which "we" are obliged to reject as if merely an outmoded and unfortunate way of thinking. I think, though, she was on the right philosophical track, a trajectory which forces one to realize the argument so given and the terms so defined are imprecise and in need of rigor.

So, I asked my question, "What criteria makes something count as 'habitual' in terms of the governmental?" Apparently Austin provides no conclusive answer to this in his essay ("A Positivist Conception of Law"). As it turns out, it may be an axiom or presupposition of Austin's system.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>1</strong> Establish a position in the "ought-can" debate. Initial position: ought <em>does not</em> imply can. The popular position is that ought does imply can, which is to say, what one ought to perform implies that one can perform that action. First I need to get clear on what exactly the form of the argument is and whether it even is coherent, then I need to understand the "popular" arguments set by those in support of, what on its face to me, looks like a silly thesis. At first sight, it seems that we can never sincerely talk about what one ought to do, since for every time we "raise the bar" beyond one's capacities, it logically follows (by contraposition) that this person ought not perform that action. This is Trey's argument, which is like in kind to Moore's argument to the Skeptic about the External World.

<strong>2 </strong>Understand the Diagonal Argument and Wittgenstein's criticisms of talk about "magnitude" in terms of cardinality of "infinite sets." What does it mean to say something is an "irrational number"? In my talk with Trey, it was conveyed that these entities are sequences (correction: each irrational should be called a "series" rather than a "sequence"), and I perhaps (un)successfully inferred, by analogy, that they are "machinery" or perhaps rules. Is each irrational number a rule for continuation of its decimal expansion? Of course, pi is not a number like the number 4 is a number, in that giving the number pi the appellation "pi" ought not trick us into believing its mathematical manipulation comes in the same way that the number 4 might be arithmetically manipulated and used. Generally, Wittgenstein was opposed to talk of "one infinity being greater (in magnitude) than another." Trey has conveyed to me, as well, that "listing the irrationals" is absurd.

<strong>3 </strong>Does logical psychologism play a large part in Kant? Is it the case that we must treat the laws of psychology like the laws of logic? Do the laws of psychology have has their foundation the laws of logic, or vice versa? What does it mean to obey a logical law? Does obeying a logical law look anything like obeying a physical law? If the categorical imperative is best understood as a logical law, since our "laws of rationality (psychology)", then what about the thesis that the laws of logic have no content (Wittgenstein)? That is, the laws of logic are not about the world or have worldly matters as their content. If the categorical imperative is best understood as a logical law, what if I tell the logic professor: "Is wish not to have any concrete examples in this course that you teach. Please, teach me logic proper, and use only a dry symbolism." Thus, the question is: Why does Kant choose <em>those</em> examples rather than <em>these others</em>. And if Kant's conception of morality <em>can only</em> be elucidated by presupposing the validity of talk about character traits, what happens when we consider Gilbert Harman's view that character trait explanations explain nothing (virtue ethics cannot explain, in principle, the complexity of even mundane cases of morality). Do not <em>tell</em> me Kant has chosen specifically moral cases, <em>show</em> me. Suppose we were to strip Kant's <em>Groundwork</em> from its example and dressing (of common understanding). Would we have something still which is convincing? When do I apply the imperative? And under what circumstances? For which concepts? Which actions?

<strong>4 </strong>Prescriptive universalism is a position at the level of meta-ethics. At this level, it is non-cognitivist about moral judgments, assertions, language, etc. Crudely speaking, <em>imperatives</em> as such are not truth-functional. Thus, if the only logical feature moral language has is that of imperative, then moral language is not truth-functional. If cognition is based on the notion of truth-functionality, then moral imperatives (and moral language, generally) are not cognitive. Prescriptive universalism is also a principle by which the philosopher judges the nature logical structure of moral statements to be. Further, it is the claim that moral judgments or commands or imperatives <em>must</em> have a logical form (have logical powers of implication, entailment, term substitution, etc). One cannot speak coherently about moral claims unless the logical form of the moral claim is determined. Prescriptive utilitarianism is concerned not with the meta-ethical but the ethical, the determination of right and wrong. It's based on universalizability and prescriptivity. It's philosophical genealogical line is found at the <em>willing</em> interpretation of Kant's universalization test.

<strong>5 </strong>What is knowledge? Might we assert with sound reason that it is <em>true belief</em>? And is "certainty" better understood as justified true belief? I must re-read "On Certainty" because I think the counterarguments against my view will be largely Wittgensteinian. If I can make a philosophically convincing argument that knowledge is true belief, then perhaps I can avoid Gettier-type cases.

<strong>6 </strong>Religious <em>and </em>scientific discourse can be analyzed on equal footing as language games. Both human activities can be understood as an interpretative, heuristic and self-instructional, and not merely a body of lifeless propositions, which would be the analytic philosopher's catnip. Leave it to the analytic to <em>enjoy</em> the party where the girls and boys are nicely, "appropriately," and with sufficient justification, bisected to this wall and to that. 'nuff said. Okay, not really "'nuff said." More to be said later.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The logical grammar of &quot;ought implies can&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're actually concerned with this topic, the gist of the post is this. Most argument I've seen takes Kant's principle to <em>really</em> be saying that "ought presupposes can." My friend Trey and I interpret the principle as "ought logically entails can." I think the latter interpretation is more true to logical idiom, but that's neither here nor there as far as the problem is concerned. However, my main issue treated here is that if you take the "presupposition" form, you may not understand, or may be apt to be confused by, our taking the "entailment" form. Evidence that I use for making a distinction between these two models of interpretation, or forms, comes from the presupposition form involving counterexamples which are logically distinct from the counterexamples given to me by Trey in support of his interpretation. Of course, what I need to do now is come to my own decision as to what I taken Kant to mean. Up to now, I've always taken Kant to be using the "entailment" form.

<strong>As a preliminary note: </strong>I'm starting to think my distinction breaks down. Look at this combinatorial possibilities:
<ul>
	<li>(1) Ought entails can</li>
	<li>(2) Cannot entails ought not (1 contraposition)</li>
	<li>(3) Can implies ought (ought presupposes can)</li>
	<li>(4) Ought not implies cannot (3, contraposition)</li>
</ul>
Now the question is: Which of the four options does the highlight that "what is not within one's power", as a refutation of the Kantian principle, take? To say "that is not physically possible for me" is which of the four moves? I want to say 3 is really just nonsense, or simply dodges the import of the Kantian principle. But I think the standard interpretation, the presupposition form, is just dodging the principle. By saying, "I do not have that power" is one just dodging the ought? Could not the person making the ought claim say, "Yes, but you ought to anyway." Along the family resembles, at which point can the person making the ought claim not say "Yes, but you ought to anyway?"

That's the short of it. Moving on...

The first question that must be raised regards the nature of some logical locutions. We need to assess the features of logical grammar as presented in English (or natural language, more generally).

Our components of logical grammar concern "entailment," "presupposition," and "implication." We say, in logic, that A entails B if what is true of B is modeled or is logically dependent on A's truth. But entailment also may be called "logical implication." It is typical to find in discourse that "entailment" and "implication" amount to the same thing. This concept also answers to the title "material implication," "logical entailment." What we tend to say in the English idiom is that "B follows from A" or "If A then it follows that B."

Presupposition, however, is quite different. Now, a presupposition may be implicit or explicit. A quick point to make is that it is usual, on the street, for one to start off argument with an assertion to the conclusion while drifting into the premises (often grudgingly) when requested. The philosopher, however, does this, but it is by no means expected that the assertion should be taken at that step. Often the asserted conclusion is reformulated and rephrased multiple times, but the standard procedure is to provide premises before the conclusion. Between the street argument and the philosophical social setting, presupposition is pervasive. A "presup" can often be found in either discourse, but its <em>easier</em> to pull them out of a street argument, for the typical experience is to be faced with a conclusion because in advancing an argument one is less likely to desire that expectation of painful time be spent on elucidation. That said, a presup in street argument is easier to "spot," though one might just as easily be said to have preemptively attacked a premise of some sort. Nothing is really gained in doing this.

What is concerning, however, is the implicit presupposition. As young philosophers, we often have this concept in mind when we shout "that's a presupposition." We take ourselves to be digging up, with relatively little mental effort, that which our kin and the ancestors of philosophy possible glossed over or were not privy to. Indeed, it is a task to pull out an implicit presup, so it should not come easy when careful philosophy is at hand.

A presup is a premise to a conclusion or a claim. On its own, it is uninteresting. We might say that, given our previous example, B's truth presupposes A's truth. This is just say the same thing in logical syntax, given that if A is true then B is true. If the presupposition is explicit, which is to say, we have been made aware of B's logical dependence, then the presupposition is harmless. However, if the presupposition is implicit to us, or generally, then we have the task of determining what it is that is presupposed. As philosophers, we're inclined to assume that something simply must be presupposed. This is more or less the nature of our game. Of course, at this level of discourse, having determined that something is presupposed, we can ask ourselves whether the presupposition is a decent one or one that does not trouble us any. Ideally, though, we would like the whole list, supposing this makes sense to say, of presuppositions to an argument. Naturally, though, the argument must start and end somewhere.

Covering this ground for myself, I think I can address some preliminaries regarding the ought-can distinction, which has now become a debate. It is one that has as its source the writings of Kant. Perhaps it's just a matter of Kant popularizing the notion. Kant's chapter eight of the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em> is the primordial domain of the concept, and his Imperative, generally, can be seen as likely presupposing the concept.

When I scan the literature, it seems to me that "ought implies can" (and this is a overly simplified phrasing of it) is treated as "ought presupposes can." Usually the disagreement with the concept is expressed through example. For some reason or another, it becomes A's duty (so claimed by another) to do X, but A cannot possibly do X. The typical sense to "possibility" is given by reminder that the natural laws impose limitations on us, that we are physically constituted in such a way that will not permit such an "ought," or perhaps there are constraints of some "system" in which A must work within in order to see to it that X obtains (if those constraints be violated, then it makes little sense to talk about the "system" in the first place).

Some examples are in order. By the first limitation, we cannot be legitimately commanded that we ought to fly by the powers strictly of our persons or transform ourselves into unicorns. The limitation of this kind applies equally to all humanity, but it applies as well in principle. We cannot be commanded to do that which is impossible given our physical and mental capacities.

The second example is a bit more nuanced but is related to the first. We cannot be commanded to stay awake for longer than more or less 40-50 hours, or some particular number of hours. The third example concerns what one is able to do given the infrastructure of, say, a rigid social system. No one can legitimately command that the President of the United States simply ignore every other branch of government in the fullest sense. To do so would make this person cease, in a rather quick way, to be President. In which case, the command falls flat almost as quickly as it is expressed. In terms of government, it makes no sense to command that one do what one, as a governmental or political figure, simply has not the power to accomplish.

With those examples out of the way, I cannot help but feel that we are not being troubled by a logical entailment or a material implication. In the President's defense, I might argue that the President cannot perform such an action. But I think what I would be uncovering is a presupposition, as opposed to denying an implication. The way standard counterargument against this concept goes, it would seem that what is being argued is that ought-claims presuppose possibility-claims. Thus, if the President can perform such-and-such an action, then the President ought to perform that action. Naturally, this leaves us to questioning <em>what exactly</em> ought the President to do. I think this matter, however, only arises when you think of "possibility" in its widest sense, which I think no one ever seriously employs. In its widest sense, it would be similar to robbing the statement "Everybody is at the party" of any context whatsoever when it is completed unwarranted that one should do so. To argue that one is not literally saying that "everybody is at the party" does not quite strike the right point. To look at the statement without context at all really seems to be the actual mistake. Possibility without context is really just idle talk.

Perhaps I run my argument purely off of intuition, but I can worry myself with that later. My main point is this: The way the counterargument tends to go, from what I see, suggests that the principle from which Kant works is interpreted as "ought presupposes can."

I decide to stress these points because my friend Trey has tried to run the contraposition of the "ought implies or entails can." What this means is that
<blockquote>(1) ought implies can</blockquote>
is true, if and only if,
<blockquote>(2) Cannot implies ought not</blockquote>
is true. By raising the points that I have, I am not arguing that one interpretation is right and the other wrong. However, I intuitively feel that those who interpret Kant to be saying that "ought presupposes can" may find it difficult to understand why Trey and myself address the, in the strict logical sense, "ought materially implies can" problem; or "it logically follows from what one ought to do, one can do it."

The arguments Trey entertains involves running the contraposition and then envisioning an "evil demon" scenario, where the evil demon demands that you ought to do an action that is impossible given the constraints that evil demon imposes. Here, you cannot do what the evil demon demands, so from Kant's principle (under our interpretation), you ought not do what you cannot do. Trey also considers a more down-to-earth example where you might be taken hostage and locked up. In this situation, you cannot send bread or financial assistance to your family (and under our interpretation), you ought not send bread or financial assistance. The problem has to do with the consequences this has on our common conception of morality. Morality seems concerned with nevertheless striving to do what one cannot, or what one cannot do is not entirely clearly. But if clear that one cannot perform some action, Kant's principle (under our interpretation) requires that you ought not perform it. That is, if you accept the principle yourself, <em>you</em> accept that you ought not to perform that action. But that seems downright silly and contrary to the intuitive sense of the term ought. It might be argued that the manner in which Trey and I interpret Kant's principle does not give him, or that anyone else who supports this Kantian principle, charitable grounds on which to stand. It might seem more "exciting" or plausible to interpret Kant's principle as "ought presupposes can." If that be the case, then it would sure be nice if the slogan were not repeated restated as with "implies" as the logical locution connecting the terms therein.

To run the contraposition argument on the presupposition form of Kant's principle would leave one with the claim that "what one ought not to do, one cannot do" and in its natural form "if one can, one ought" (barring the wide sense of "possibility"). But surely if saying that one ought not to murder his brother does not logically imply or entail that one cannot. This is what someone who interprets Kant's principle in the presupposition form may say if that person is not aware of the logical grammar Trey and myself take to the ought-can problem. Whether I, for instance, am using the more proper or purer logical grammar or not is not really the issue. All I seek to point out is that the two interpretations seem manifestly in conflict while at the same time both, at first blush, look like viable ways to interpret Kant's principle.

But which interpretation is right? Well, that will require some reading. I think this distinction between the presupposition form and the entailment form is relevant, however, if only as preparatory for my forthcoming endeavor to attack this problem.

<strong>Additional notes:</strong> On its face, the presupposition form, if my interpretation of that interpretation of the principle is correct, commits a logical fallacy. If one argues from the presupposition form, then when is arguing that

1. If A then B
2. Not A
3. Therefore, not B

This is called denying the antecedent. Now, the new question is: In highlighting <em>general facts about what is possible physically and logically</em> is one taking the presupposition form? The question of whether one can perform an action or not is <em>answered before the question of whether one ought to do that action.</em> So highlighting that one cannot satisfy the command is not to raise any argument <em>to the command</em> as presumably the one making the command equally has access to those limitations, or is likely making the command just because those limitations are there. What this means is that the possibility of action necessarily is a presupposition to any ought claim so long as the person making the ought claim is aware.

This may be an epistemic issue, generally, in that our true question may be: <em>Can one legitimately make an ought claim if one is not aware of the contextual possibilities?</em> If we take the presupposition form, we seriously need to answer this question: If I claim you ought to do X, it's severely important that you understand what I take your capacities to be. Simplified examples of "you ought to fly right now" are too easy and are, frankly, unilluminating. We all know you cannot fly by your own personal powers. But if the presupposition form is accepted, it is only a matter of reminder that some action is not within the powers of the agent being commanded. The presupposition form requires that when one makes an ought claim to another, one is presupposing that it is possible. To presuppose it is to say that one has already understood its possible attainment.

It would seem that ought <em>claims</em> as such necessitate that we link the claim and with the possibility through the epistemic features of agent making the command. Speak of <em>ought </em>outside of the epistemic context seems to be fruitless, as it is people or rational agents or language-users who make ought-claims. Free of epistemology, ought claims, I think, necessarily presuppose the possibility of their being satisfied, but these are vacuous and uninteresting claims, nor would we be able to articulate them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Premises which are supposed as ordinary bits of common sense:</em>
(a) Good will is good without qualification.
(b) Good will is good not because of what it effects or accomplishes nor because of its fitness to attain some proposed end; it is only good through its willing, that is, good in itself.
(c) Only actions motivated by duty have genuine moral worth.
(d) An action done from duty has its moral worth, not in the purpose that is to be attained by it, but in the maxim according to which the action is determined.
(e) Duty is the necessity of an action done out of respect for law.
(f) I should never act except in such a way that I can also will that my maxim should become universal law.

<strong>Notes: </strong>Remember, these are supposed by Kant to be "common notions of morality." What this means is that Kant cannot transition <em>from</em> the ordinary sense of morality to the philosophical if he has not sufficiently given an account of the common notion of morality. So, what the "person on the street" thinks morality is about.

Of course, if (common notion) then (philosophical notion) is an entailment. Showing that Kant's account of the common notion to be false or absurd does not logically entail that his philosophical notion is false. However, if we show his philosophical notion to be false, then <em>if</em> it logically follows from his common notion account, then his common notion account must be false as well, or at least, it must have some problem in its premises or logical constitution.

<em>Questions about Kant's claim that only actions motivated by duty have genuine moral worth:</em>
(1) What does Kant mean by "actions motivated by duty" and "genuine moral worth"?
(2) Is it intuitively plausible that only actions motivated by duty have genuine moral worth?
(3) Why does Kant think that actions motivated by inclination lack moral worth?

(3.1) These actions are either selfish or unreliable.
(3.11) If selfish, then voluntarisms and altruism seem to make little sense as concepts. Selfishness does not seem to explain these two concepts.
(3.12) If unreliable, then what does it mean to be "morally reliable"? Is "reliability" not a constraint exclusive to the language of "utility"? Why not run the "reliability" criticism right back actions from duty?

Other comments: We still have the question of what constitutes morality, if anything. Kant's claim is that its content is conformity to duty. But "conformity" is not a content that itself can be judged as morally valuable or morally deplorable on its on. Conformity presupposes that which is to be systematized or uniform; so, we can still ask: Which actions can I will consistently? The test itself tells us nothing about the content of morality, but the form it must follow it. Is this question damaging to Kant's general conception of morality?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Does the scientist <em>really </em>think electron clouds are just like the ones drawn in cartoons? Surely not. Atomic and subatomic particles are theoretical constructs. We wouldn't dare ask a scientist to <em>draw </em>an electron cloud under the demand that it be <em>categorically accurate</em>. We should give the same charity to religious language. To them, is heaven or hell or whatever really just earth under differing conditions? Is the electron cloud just another cloud under differing conditions?

Surely, we admit that actual electron "clouds" are categorically distinct from clouds in the sky or clouds of dust. But yet we accept the metaphor. To treat religious language on <em>unequal </em>footing to w/r/t scientific language robs the religious person of the kind of metaphor we happily (or perhaps not so happily, as Wittgensteinians) allow for the scientist to employ, but that is a double standard and is philosophically dubious nevertheless.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To work my chops:

<em>Deontic:</em> moral import (the question of whether an action is moral or not) centers on <em>obligatory </em>and <em>permissible </em>action. An <em>obligatory action</em> is that action which is viewed by its agent as, in some sense, (logically, out of respect for law; as a contradiction, its opposite is necessarily determined) necessary, whereas a <em>permissible action</em> is simply the negation of necessary action. Right action is that action taken with its obligation in view; wrong action is that action taken which is flouts obligation. Permissible action has no moral worth; it is morally empty. Moral goodness, in effect, is reconsidered as moral rightness <em>and </em>is constrained by moral rightness. What this means is that rightness makes goodness possible. If X is the right action, X has a possibility of being good. X is good only if X is right; if X is not right, then X is not good.

<em>Teleological: </em>moral worth is defined in terms of some goal or end or purpose. However, it is important to ground the "goal" in further terms of something else. For the purpose or goal of deontic ethics could be seen as that ethical system which does not appeal to "lesser goals," in the face of them, as it were. The teleological ethical system takes moral worth to be conditioned on the "results" of action or rules conducive to action. Thus, the object of an action, rather than the principle by which that action is determined, is the object of moral worth. The <em>object of action</em> and the <em>principle of action</em> are contrasted between the teleological and the deontic systems.

<em>Virtue ethics:</em> Is a vocabulary of moral terms (virtues and vice) which have an unknown and whimsical criterion for their application. Does a mastery of one's language imply that one is a sufficient virtue ethicist in application? Is virtue ethics the terminological underpinning of all ethical inquiry? Is it the case that linguistic practices more or less embody moral systems, given the virtue ethicist's account? Can the virtue ethicist seriously <em>solve</em> ethical problems if the normative vocabulary of an linguistico-ethical context <em>is</em> the problem? Is the virtue ethicists role simply to remind us what our terms <em>mean</em>, as opposed to arguing for solutions or dissolution?

<em>Cognitive: </em>A meta-ethical presupposition held by...

Virtue ethicists: the criterion for applying a moral term, once satisfied, for that community or person applying the moral term, entails that it is true of X that X <em>is </em>Y for that person or community, where Y is a moral term. Thus, it becomes a fact for that person or that community that X is Y. This fact is either true or false. However, the descriptive-normative distinction is important, for anyone can say, while lacking the ethical tone, "Bill is courageous" without at the same time thinking any normative claims follow from that. It is true that "Bill is courageous" can be viewed as a stated fact about the linguistic practice of some community; e.g., "People tend to say on occasion, 'Bill is courageous' because Bill did such-and-such." However, one might go the normative route and derive implications on the <em>moral fact </em>of Bill's courageousness. Thus, for example, "If Bill is courageous, then one ought to emulate Bill" is the staple example of a virtue ethical normative claim. Rosalind Hursthouse thinks, however, that virtue ethics is more than just the crude example just given; that is, it's more than just a practical guide for picking out the "moral idol."

Deontologists would hold that an action from duty shows that it is true of certain duties that they are objectively obligatory. Thus, it is true that "One ought not to commit suicide" because this action conceptually (at some possible world) destroys itself. Perhaps deontologists are the strongest moral realists (that there are mind-independent facts of the matter to which morality corresponds).

Teleological ethical systems would hold that if some object is <em>good</em>, under its definition, then it is true that we ought to seek to attain that object or state of affairs. However, the obvious <em>problem </em>is moral subjectivism: How can we account for the variety of objects held to be good and thus true for some locality that it should seek to attain it, in the face of others who hold its opposite to be good? Thus, it would be a moral fact that if I hold love to be good because it helps me acquire a job, it is morally required of me to find love.

<em>Noncognitive:</em> Emotivism, universal prescriptivism, expression, etc hold that ethical statements are not truth-apt, and thus are not truth-functional propositions. "You ought to do X" is not in the same category as "You are wise." The first issue is that the latter has a criterion or criteria for its application. It's silly to look for the criterion or criteria for the former. Nothing will make it true or false. There's no fact of the matter because the former cannot possibly be true, its a conceptually different thing. "You ought to do X because Y" is equally incapable of being true because the "ought" locution is resistent to truth constraints. My initial thought is that "ought" considers some future state of affairs, or a future picture. Given Hume's skeptical outlook about our logical inferences, it cannot follow that whatever Y, one is logically required to perform X. It would be silly to even think of ethical norms as being mere dictates of logic; logic doesn't demand that we do anything. Further, it does not follow by anyone else's logical inference that I must see some state of affairs obtain. It would seem fruitless to consider "ought" claims to have nothing more than the logical feature that one should bring some state of affairs about. If knowledge depends on truth, then if noncognitivism is true, moral knowledge cannot be had.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>KTB and Gettier-cases (preliminary steps)</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA["KTB" stands for <em>knowledge as true belief</em>. This epistemological position is concerned with the definition of knowledge, what is logically necessary, what is logically sufficient, and what is the criterion or criteria for knowledge.  Epistemic minimalism, as it is called, strips <em>justification </em>from its rank among necessary conditions for knowledge; it is implied, then, that true belief are necessary, independently, and sufficient, when combined, for knowledge. Thus, S knows P if and only if

(1) S believes P

(2) P is true

Together (1) and (2) are sufficient; individually, they are necessary. Justification, however, is not unimportant to knowledge, as it functions logically as a<em> criterion</em> for one to determine that S knows P. Knowledge itself, however, does not presuppose justification as a necessary <em>condition</em>.

The aspiration I have for filing myself among the ranks of epistemic minimalists such as, more recently, Sartwell and others is to aid me in seeing just how the Gettier problem is in fact no problem at all. As opposed to adding a forth logical condition to knowledge, I should wish to gain some ground, thus showing the Gettier problem, and its cases, to be a fluke, by subtracting a logical condition and emphasizing the logical constitution of belief. Initially, I should like to address Gettier's more popular counterexamples by showing that they do not in fact carry proper accounts of belief, and then I should like to move on to more general Gettier-type cases, following the same line of argument of using an enriched notion of belief.

It should be fruitful for my own business that I should add my thoughts on what counts as belief or what I mean by "constitution of belief." Centering on this point will be my discussion of what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for <em>belief. </em>It should follow, I think, from that account of belief, that the counter cases brought against justified true belief in fact lack the kind of belief I have in mind. Because of this lack of a more intuitive and full notion of belief, many philosophers are predisposed to holding that justification is the condition that really undermines knowledge. Perhaps I should show that it is in fact an insufficient account of belief that makes Gettier-cases possible, or that if we remove justification from knowledge, we will indeed think that Smith actually did know that Smith would get the job, etc.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1. The skeptic whines, "Do we actually judge for ourselves?"

2. If you're hinting at some kind of strict determinism, which would imply that we are not in control of what we come to judge, thus we must not be the <em>true</em> judge in the end, then you're making the No True Scotsman fallacy.

There's nothing within the concept of "judgment" that requires one be in complete control of all that which is to be reflected upon when in judgment. It's simply not what the word means. The kind of question you ask presupposes that the word has no meaning whatsoever, but clearly "judgment" has meaning, and clearly we do, sometimes, make judgments for ourselves.

The question of whether we "always" actually judge for ourselves needs refinement. If you mean, "When the doctor hits my knee, did I judge it to be the right reaction to kick my leg and thus acted upon my judgment" then surely you don't in this case mean "reaction" in the traditional and conventional sense.

As you can see, our concepts form a vast web, in which they are all interconnected and support one another. If you get "too philosophical" with one concept, you clearly see that in order to sustain your philosophical itch, you must begin to treat any number of other concepts as having peculiar and overly philosophical and ungrounded senses.

3. As with that example of "reaction," the conclusion is that "judgment" is not at all involved. It would be peculiar to think of one judging that one ought to kick one's leg. Thus, kinds of human activity do not involve judgment, that is for sure. But there is some activity that does not involve judgment and which should not, as I further claim, give us evidence to believe that we are not master of our own judgment some of the time. We quickly learn that before we can pose the hyperskeptical question, we've done nothing more than abuse our conceptual underpinnings; before our question begins, it fails because it is an abuse of philosophical grammar (which must be constrained by the underpinnings of our ordinary, every-day language).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mereological Fallacy in Neuroscience</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Believe it or not, but some philosophers (PMS Hacker) and (neuro)scientists (Mas Bennett) think, and have argued extensively, that contemporary neuroscience is sorely underpinned by widespread conceptual confusion. Today's neuroscientists (Crick, Damasio, etc), they have argued in their voluminous text, are continuing a long Cartesian Dualist tradition...only now instead of predicating of the "mind" certain properties such as "being angered," "being thoughtful," "thinking thus and so," neuroscientists have switched nouns. Now, what philosophers before the advent of neuroscientist attributed to the mind, they, along with neuroscientists, physicalists, reductionists and eliminative materialists attribute to the brain. Chomsky and his crew try to stay out of the metaphysical playground, though their stance is just as confused, by playing both cards (the "mind/brain").

Wittgenstein noted that it makes sense to say "it has sensations; it sees, is blind; hears, is deaf; is conscious or unconscious" (Philosophical Investigations, § 281) only of a human being.

I agree. It makes no sense, and is conceptually incoherent to say that the brain believes, thinks, interprets, loves, is angered, and so on. Thus, it is meaningless, and equally meaningless inferences follow if such conceptual background is admitted into neuroscientific and neurocognitive scientific thinking.

To me, it seems hardly worth arguing for. Reductionist naturalists, who are not yet eliminative materialists, note that if we get accurate predictions from our neural correlates, this warrants out identifying the emotion, for instance, with the the neural-synaptic state. But this is confused, for one is not arguing for a true identity thesis under these terms, for it is by the definition of "correlate" and all its underpinnings that makes it conceptually incoherent to say that the brain, or even worse its neurons, is indeed "content."

It is confused to think that the utterance "I am angry" is a reference to an "internal state" of the brain. It makes no sense to think that my utterance that "I think that cats are furry" is an indication of a brain or mental state. 

One immediate problem with this is one that should be readily seen. When you wish to rephrase, or fully restate the activities you've gone through in the process of writing a paper or complete a an intellectually demanding project, you might say to a friend, "I've thought," "I reflected," "I recalled," "I assumed," "I considered," "I reconsidered," and so on. All of these psychological verbs form a vast conceptual structure that pulls and tugs when one term, or verb, is given a sense not familiar, or conventional, to it. Each verb is related and dependent on the others. If you wish to ascribe the psychological predicate of thought, for instance, to the brain, then you must be willing to shift the entire semantic field based on that criterion for application of that verb.

Thus, you must be ready to admit that the brain "reflects," recalls," "assumes," "considers," "reconsiders," and so on. To me, it thus seems obvious that eliminative material about psychological predicate, for instance, is confused. Strong physicalism about mind, too, is utterly confused.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1. X will walk through the door.
2. X will walk through the door and X will step through the door frame.

Which is more probable? <em>That</em> is the feeling--of annoyance: one which strikes me when I see the traditional "fallacy" in action. The comparison of conjunction and conjuncts has a fishiness about it.

At a dull party. A man asks you in a serious tone, "Where's the party?" Is this sarcasm? How do you tell? What have I given? How might you ignore that and my question, but nevertheless <em>answer</em> me?

[Edit: I think I remember why this post exists; it makes very little sense now. Something about a particular kind of fallacious argument that involves measuring the combined probability of mutually exclusive conjuncts and comparing that total with only one of those conjuncts, one used to produce that total. I think it came from my philosophy of social science course. It's a well known study; I'll cite it soon.]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We do not think <em>in </em>any medium. We think <em>into </em>language, not <em>in </em>language. Thought is not a quasi-language or a quasi-method of expression. To use idiom such as "the language of thought" is to speak figuratively. A necessary condition for a word is that it consist of a finite concatenation of symbols or markings; a picture a finite set of strokes, markings, shapes, lines, etc. Thoughts, or thinking, do not satisfy, and thus do not depend upon or presuppose, such a necessary condition. Thus, to claim that we think in terms of words or pictures or symbols is to claim something that is literally false. We mustn't take idiomatic expression literally, but neither can we call idiomatic expression strictly <em>metaphorical</em>. At first blush such expressions seem in need of conceptual decomposition, to arrive at some "deeper" meaning. Here we can, and often do, make the inappropriate interpretation of the constituents of the expression, taking them to <em>refer</em>. This notion of reference can entangle us, and thus difference principle of conceptual interpretation is needed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes it simply is not worth it. For example,
<blockquote>We are not in disagreement because you did not comprehend what my assertion meant. Perhaps you do not understand the linguistic expression "just like."

By saying that X is of Y and that X is just like Z insofar as Z is of Y, I am saying that X and Z share the property of being members of the set Y.

What you have said does not refute my claim because nothing in the definition of "natural language" presupposes that it only describe languages which have a phonetic aspect. "Natural language" does not mean "language with a phonetic aspect."

Thus, sign language is just like English in that it is a natural language.

Why on earth would I say "sign language is just like English" where "just like" stands to mean that you can <em>hear</em> sign language (just like you <em>hear </em>English) too? Really...why on earth?</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Ordinary Language philosophy arose as a way out of some vexing problems. For example, we've banged our heads against the wall for thousands of years trying to figure out what "reality" is. What makes something "real"? Is it because it has matter? Is it because it exists independent of our awareness? If so, how could we tell? And is that where headwaiters come from? Many thousands of bored freshmen (and one Woody-Allen-ish gag) later, we're no closer to understanding what makes reality real.

Along come the witty Ordinary Language philosophers. Stop with all the pondering of those special words in philosophy, they say. Instead, they recommend, look at how we use them words in casual conversation, for that's where words get their meaning. For example, "reality" shows up in phrases such as "In reality,..." in which it functions like the word "However." We don't spend thousands of years trying to figure out what "However" is because we know it's just a way of telling listeners that we're about deny what we just said. Only philosophers make the mistake of thinking that "reality" is the name of something. In short: Ordinary Language analysis subverts the attempt to figure out meanings in abstraction from how they are used.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A proposition that attributes a predicate to a thing must be shown to have sense before its truth can be determined. More specifically, whether a psychological predicate can intelligibly and coherently be attributed to a thing is a matter of that predication's sense, not its truth. Thus, whether or not it makes sense to say of the brain that it thinks, believes, interprets, knows, etc is not going to be shown by appeal to empirical findings or results.

The proposition "The brain thinks" can be true or false, can have sense or lack sense. Its sense cannot be grounded in the truth of some empirical result because it is the already understood sense of the terms constitutive to the proposition which make for the proposition, as a whole, to receive the possibility of being judged "true" or "false."]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It seems absurd to say that one acts in accordance with duty, for it the category of "acting from duty" gives a meaning to the term "duty" something categorically different from the meaning found in the category of "acting in accordance with duty."

Surely, "duty," when acting in accordance with it, is not some other kind of duty from which you could act. If it is, we must assume that the set of all duties which you can act in accordance with are possible duties from which you could act.

We seem to be saying that acts can have as their source or motivation inclination or duty. But the set of those acts from inclination and from duty are the same set.

The set of acts that are in accordance with duty is not the same set as acts done from duty. Therefore, we can distinguish acts done from duty and acts done in accordance with duty. But what about being "naturally inclined" makes the sets different? Acting from duty is never a matter of natural inclination.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Consider:

1 acting from duty and in accordance with inclination;

1.1 You might reap benefits in addition to having moral import to your action.

2 acting from duty and contrary to inclination;

2.1 You might not reap benefits, or suffer pains, but maintain moral import.

3 acting from inclination and contrary to duty;

3.1 No moral important, but morally wrong? Which is it? It would seem that "from inclination" along lacks all moral import. "Contrary to duty" would be a condition for moral wrongness.

4 acting from inclination and in accordance with duty;

4.1 No moral worth, like "from inclination" solely. So this one reduces to that. This is why I think "duty" in the "in accordance" form is equivocal w/r/t "duty" in the "from duty" form--because 4 reduces to, insofar as its moral status, that of solely acting from inclination. "in accordance with duty" adds nothing; so it seems that "duty" of this sense does not imply that it is a "possible source for future moral import." Ask the question: If I see that I acted in accordance with duty (duty X), what if I {act from it} next time? How might I see that I {could} act in accordance with duty? If I see that I {could} act in accordance with it, what might prompt me to act merely in accordance with it (as opposed to explicitly choosing to act from it)? If I see that it is a "duty" which I could act in accordance with, and it is indeed my own duty, it would seem that I'd opt to act from it, rather than merely in accordance with it. If I {see} rightly that it is my duty.

5. acting contrary to both inclination and duty.

5.1 What does "contrary" mean? It seems to have a passive and active interpretation. I can act against a duty of mine, which presupposes that I am not acting from it (for I might have another duty opposed to it). This would be the active interpretation. I act contrary to you in that I actively oppose you. The passive interpretation is such that I inadvertently act not from duty (so inclination). So, acting from inclination entails that you are not acting from duty. But does "contrary" mean "passive opposition"? Or does it mean "active opposition"? I can act against one of my duties, or I can simply not act from it (while acting from an inclination that is coincidentally opposed to that duty). But in this latter case, we have two more interpretations: My inclination can be coincidentally against my duty or I can have an inclination that is actively against my duty.) Are these fruitful distinctions to make?]]></wp:comment_content>

4. Supposing that you deny 1, what is your position on mind-independent facts? It would seem that a non-contingent fact just is a mind-independent fact.

5. Suppose that you have two systems of fact (moral and legal; religious and scientific; philosophical and social), can one be 'reduced' to the other? Can all the facts of a religious system of fact explain and describe in sum the system of fact therein the scientific? What sense would the concept of fact in the latter bear relationally to the sense of the concept of fact in the former? Can we call a second-order (religious) fact a fact? In the same sense as a first-order (scientific) fact? These questions are about the reductive methodological principle. Is this principle justified?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Knowledge defined</span>

Pre-Gettier and Post-Gettier we generally and more or less plausibly hold (1)

Knowledge is justified true belief. We might outline this as follows.

S knows P if and only if
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
	<li>S believes P</li>
	<li>S has evidence for P</li>
	<li>and P is a true fact about the world</li>
</ol>
Alone 1-3 are necessary and together they are sufficient for the predication of knowledge to S. Post-Gettier many epistemologists came to hold that some fourth property or condition need be provided, but we can ignore that for now.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Skepticism defined (more or less)</span>

Now, skepticism captures a broad range of theories which hold doubts about knowledge or its properties (1-3). Some might be
<blockquote>i. Doubt as to our our justification (evidence), that it is lacking in some particular cases (everyday, mundane, weak skepticism),

ii. Consists of (only) falsehoods (error theory about knowledge),

iii. Possible knowledge is doubtful (Pyrrhonian skepticism)

iv. Or is radically and systematically unjustified (Cartesian skepticism).</blockquote>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some derivative positions</span>

I wish to clarify a few derivative positions which combine the properties of knowledge and skeptical approaches. We might approach these derivatives through this outline:

a. Do not exist
b. Is always inadequate or insufficient
c. Is always false

So, by combination of a. and 1. we get

a1: Beliefs do not exist

And so on...

a2: Evidence does not exist; Justification does not exist
a3: Facts do not exist; true and false facts do not exist

b1: Beliefs are always inadequate or insufficient (all beliefs are not <em>really </em>beliefs)
<blockquote>b1i. I might say, "You don't really belief that." Thus, I judge the adequacy or perhaps authenticity of your belief.</blockquote>
b2: Evidence is always inadequate or insufficient; justification is always inadequate or insufficient
b3: Facts are always inadequate or insufficient

c1: Beliefs are always false
c2: Evidence always leads to false conclusions or can never have true conclusions
c3: Facts are always contingently false, even if they could (possibly) be true

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Beliefs</span>

Now in my exploration I stumbled onto a weird one. "Beliefs do not exist."

This is quite strange for it seems plausible that one might argue, "Look, your belief isn't really a belief."

So the same with our Knowledge defined section, we might outline belief as follows.

S believes Q if and only iff
<blockquote>...</blockquote>
And that's where I get loopy. <em><strong>What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for belief or to say that S beliefs something?</strong></em> What are your thoughts on this particular issue or anything I've given above?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Meaning just is use" is a claim which has come to be a slogan. The slogan is largely what is attacked, and those unfamiliar with Wittgenstein's method will be wont to misunderstand, or simply ignore, exactly that on which the slogan was founded.

The "monsterous conjunction" objection is no serious objection, for it is exactly the kind of argument which an uncharitable reader might make if he or she carelessly (willfully or inattentively) plucked any claim from the Philosophical Investigations, then ran with it. I do not agree with the claim that Wittgenstein is an obscurantist. That one needs to "seriously" and "attentively" read Wittgenstein is no less a recommendation we give to anyone when reading any (other) author or thinker. And this monsterous conjunction argument, I think, is nothing more than an uncharitable strike sourced by the inattentive logic chopper--valid, but irrelevant. And no, you don't need to be a card-carrying Wittgensteinian to understand what Wittgenstein was arguing, or underscoring, or intimating. All you need to do is <em>read </em>the field around the "meaning is use" claim, and look at the book comprehensively. Though, <em>this </em>is not my argument; but anyone will tell you that if you're going to criticize the doctrine, at least take other aspects into account. To treat <em>one </em>claim as if all the rest could 'reduce' to it nicely and easily would likely be a false start in Wittgenstein's eyes, a great offense too. Heck, I find it offensive, and I am hardly as cynical toward the Analytic school as he was.

So what exactly is the argument? Then we'll entertain some counters, where we'll have to inspect exactly our object of study (the slogan).

Suppose you say "I am going to wear a green shirt today" to your significant other. Clear "meaning"; clear (presumably) "use." Go on, imagine its use. Whatever <em>you </em>imagine is "part" of my argument. Fun. You've done half the work for me. Thanks. (I'd love to explore intuition swapping, "appeal to intuition" and "intuition imagery," but I'll do that in some other rant/quasi-argument.)

Now suppose I say "I'm going to wear jeans." Both declaratives have a clear meaning strictly grammatically and conversationally. They also have a use, to indicate to all within hearing range (of whom I'm likely aware since I don't talk to myself about matters such as these, etc) that I am going to wear a certain <em>ensemble.</em> (Uh oh, tricky. Am I <em>literally, grammatically, </em>passing off that I am going to wear <em>an ensemble</em>?) Or I am only passing off two logical conjuncts. Anyway, the meaning and use are clear. <em>Jeans</em>, <em>shirts</em>, <em>wearing </em>all refer to something to which we are each familiar (things such as this, actions such as that). The use is to communicate <em>something</em>--we usually say <em>what one will wear.</em> (But what about the "and" here? Does that turn "what one will wear" into a validly substitutible term like "ensemble"?--<em>one's ensemble.</em>)

Anyway, so the argument goes: Look, statement 1 and statement 2 each have a meaning and a use independently. Imagine a possible world, etc etc. Conjoined they also have a pretty clear meaning and use. Imagine a possible world, etc etc. But hey, what if we conjoined 1 and 2 and some other ordinary statement? And another? And another? Thus, we get the monsterous conjunction. This is supposed to be a clear cut case of "meaning just is use" falling into incoherency. In uttering, suppose, sentence-as-conjunction-43 (at some possible world) we get a sentence with a clear (?) meaning but no use (?).

Well, that's it. By logic, if it has no use, then it has no meaning. But does it <em>really </em>have a meaning? For whom? Where? When? It certainly has a meaning for the purposes of doing logic in that the sentences each refer. If you conjoin 1 twenty times one will refer successfully if one utters it. By English it's meaningful. Write it down twenty times and each time it is a grammatical sentence, etc. But what <em>does </em>Wittgenstein mean by <em>meaning? </em>Does the monstrous conjunction argument uncharitably or just baldly treat of an impoverished, low definition of meaning? (Remember my field analogy? Does this argument <em>read the field </em>inadequately?)

So what is the intended use by the argument? One might say, "Sure it has a use: to complete the argument itself!" Should we swap intuitions now so that I might understand this argument as the one who advances it does?

And what of its principle of approach? Suppose by the same principle of this presumed counter I take 1 and conjoin it to itself one hundred times. Have I succeeded in making a point? But more specifically, would this sentence have so clear a meaning as, presumably, sentence-as-conjunction-43 does? Are meanings like <em>points? </em>100 meaning points versus 43 meaning points? Something seems awry.

The standard objection to this counter is that logical-and is nothing like English-and (or French-et). Logic 'reduces' these natural language conjunction terms for the purpose of the logician. It would, on this account, be foolish to think that an argument with 400 premises in a logic classroom is <em>just like </em>your friend carrying on in making her point where here and there the same 400 premises (pretty long conversation) crop up.

What if I were to not use the English-and to conjoin 1 and 2? What if I merely stated 2 immediately after 1? Or 1 immediately after 2? You perhaps don't see the significance of these questions. But honestly, this counter feels, to me, like a mistake made by a child when it learns about cardinality.

Set A has ten members which are the first ten numbers of N <em>randomized </em>where N is the set of all natural numbers. So, Set A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 } (hey, it can happen). Set B = { 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 9, 6, 7, 10, 5 }. You ask a child (just after teaching it how to count to 10), <em>What is the value of the fourth cardinal position in set A? </em>The child replies confidently and emphatically, "Four!" You ask the same question, but of set B; the child replies again in the same manner, confidently and resolutely, "Four!" Something's gone wrong; a concept has not been learned.

Conjoined sentence 1 <em>and </em>2 and 2 <em>and </em>1 <em>mean </em>the same thing to logic or to one who is in the logical mood. Or, perhaps, when you're playing the language game of <em>doing logical proof. </em>And to my question about saying, perhaps, "1... 2..."; will we translate the <em>ellipsis </em>or the <em>pause in my speech... </em>into <em>what </em>becomes our "logical-and"?--"Ah, it is the nature of the propositions themselves which indicate to you whether or not a conjunction is apt." Yes, I agree. For if 1 and 2 were, respectively, "My cat is pink all over" and "My cat is green all over", we would surely not take one to be <em>meaning </em>a contradiction. We might be charitable and interpret these two statements as "My cat is ... <em>now.</em>"

I really cannot give a "knock down" refutation because Wittgenstein, in the first place, is giving a clear cut <em>theory </em>to which one says, "Now it is conclusively shown to be false." Perhaps you can do this. Perhaps it's a fault in Wittgenstein's way of thinking that makes it evidently untenable to most thinkers. Perhaps, further, it is my own bias which compels me to say this, but if it isn't a theory in the first place, to speak of "knocking it down" seems a bit misleading. In any case, I cannot give a "solid" counterobjection not because of Wittgenstein's approach, but I--again, as I may just be biased--cannot see this conjunction argument as even within the same ballpark as the albeit a slogan "meaning is use" claim. I cannot so much refute it as I feel I must dismiss it. It looks inadequate from the start. It's a queer exploration in what one can do with logic.

I might be able to refute the scientific theory of evolution or gravity if I strongarm and 'reduce' it to whatever meaning logic allows.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><strong>criterion.</strong> A standard by which to judge something; a feature era thing by which it can be judged to be thus and so. In the writings of the later Wittgenstein it is used as a quasitechnical term. Typically, something counts as a criterion for another thing if it is necessarily good evidence for it. Unlike inductive evidence, criterial support is determined by convention and is partly constitutive of the *meaning of the expression for whose application it is a criterion. Unlike *entailment, criterial support is characteristically defeasible. Wittgenstein argued that behavioural expressions of the 'inner', e.g. groaning or crying out in pain, are neither inductive evidence for the mental (Cartesianism), nor do they entail the instantiation of the relevant mental term (behaviourism), but are defeasible criteria for its application.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Under some accounts of (and in papers which defend) epistemic minimalism, true belief (sans justification) is defended as a plausible definition of knowledge.

1. Essentially the idea is that "belief" has not been given a rich enough qualification or has been given an insufficient characterization by those who accept "justified true belief" as knowledge.

2. True belief as knowledge is usually attacked on account of hallucination and schizophrenia cases. But the counter is usually given that beliefs must be, by our ordinary conception of belief (think preferences), acquired in a more or less causally appropriate manner.

So, for instance, people clinically diagnosed as mentally handicapped or psychotic seem to have beliefs, but certain classes of beliefs are generally denied to them as bearers of those beliefs. So, for instance, the belief that one is in a padded room might be legit while the belief that pluto has martians on it (uttered every other year) is not. A random sequence of utterance that happens to sound like "I believe X" would not be attributed to a person. For instance, we wouldn't attribute beliefs to a parrot.

On hallucination: Suppose you're induced into a coma and someone "injects" (by some means) into your brain "the belief that X"; I'd doubt that we'd say <em>you</em> legitimately or genuinely hold that belief. On the supposition, we'd simply say that you were induced to say it or you got it in the wrong way. There seems to be a "coherency in acquisition."

This is perhaps evidenced by theist/atheist feuding. Each side of the camp says "they only think they believe (God talks to them) or (Science tells them the right morality)" which is just another way of saying "they only believe they believe." This kind of talk is nonsensical and absurd, but it intimates, I think, the idea that Science or God could literally speaking to us, even if true, would give us "beliefs" in an inauthentic way or by cheating.

Even if God decided to tell you this or that, I'd still think it mysterious that you could even <em>get</em> a belief at all because God's supposed to be outside of the normal flow of things. Getting beliefs through flux seems suspect. We generally hold that people must get their beliefs through some standard and normal process.

So the <em>reason</em> for our believing something or having the belief at all seems to be necessarily within a certain class of possible reasons. And perhaps this is a necessary condition.

For instance, in order for me to genuinely say, at all, that I believe in God. I must go to church for some number of years, have religious parents, perhaps, etc etc. No one would say I really have the belief at all if I behave and act as a self-described atheist for 30 years and suddenly and unexpectedly, one Wednesday morning, start saying "I believe in Christ (in the Christian sense)"--especially if I own not one copy of the Bible. People would likely think I'm being insincere or playing a joke or hit my head or am being coerced. But what do people know? In any case, it seems there's something essentially public about <em>having beliefs at all</em> or <em>being said to have beliefs by others</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A pdf version:</h3>
Download link (58.3 KB): <a href="http://blog.nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/an-outline-to-epistemology.pdf">an-outline-to-epistemology</a>
<h3>General point of epistemology</h3>
"Epistemology" is the study of knowledge. Many philosophers take it to be <em>the investigation into the conditions for knowledge. </em>Some think those conditions are largely psychological in nature.

When we speak of "knowledge" in Epistemology, we mean knowledge-that knowledge. We mean "propositional knowledge." Propositional knowledge covers a wide range of propositions, some mundane (like "You are wearing a hat right now") to scientific (like "The universe consists of X subatomic particles") to extramundane (like "God is the supreme creator of the Universe").

In analyzing such propositions, we map them to the definition of knowledge (provided below).
<h3>"Epistem-ology"</h3>
"Episteme" translates to, from the Greek, "knowledge." "-ology" means "study" or "reason" or "science" (it is derivative on "logos").

It's important to note that "knowledge-how" is related to the Greek "techne." These two classes of knowledge firmly exclude one another. I might know how to ride a bike without knowing any proposition about bikes nor might I even know what to tell you to help you ride one. This kind of knowledge is <em>unrelated to the definition so given.
</em>
<h3>Knowledge is different from belief</h3>
Look, when someone says "I know that you are happy right now" they are saying something, raising the epistemic bar, so to speak, quite different from "I believe that you are happy right now".

If the former, you might be skeptical and ask for <em>justification </em>or you might say "No, no, the truth of the matter is thus."

If the latter, you very likely will not ask for justification. You might just brush it off with some cliche like "To each his own" or "So many heads, so many opinions."

In a word, knowledge is <em>stronger </em>than belief. It is essential that you understand their relation. Knowledge, knowledge-that in this case, <em>presupposes </em>belief. It is essential that you understand what "presupposition" means.

Knowledge presupposes justification, belief, and truth. In this way, in this sentence, we mean <em>more-than-just plausible justification</em> or <em>evidence</em>, <em>genuine belief</em>, <em>true statements. </em>Knowledge would not presuppose insincere beliefs, unconvincing evidence or falsehoods. Just think about it; that's silly.
<h3>What we mean when we say that we know</h3>
This issue here is <em>not</em> just about predicating knowledge to someone. It is not just about saying "Oh he knows", though predication is very important and factors in. This is not just about watching TV and applying the definition to the people on the screen. It is the <em>definition </em>of knowledge, not just the grounds for ascription. Imagine someone you've never met before and will never meet. You have no character profile of this person. This person is faceless and has no identity but more or less can apply reason and thought. Think about the <em>bare minimum </em>this person can know, given the right resources and evidence and being charitable.
<h3>A definition of knowledge(-that)</h3>
S knows that p iff
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">S believes that p (<strong>belief condition</strong>) iff</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">S thinks that p is true</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">S acquires the belief that p in a causally appropriate way (normative principle of belief formation)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">S has evidence to believe that p (<strong>justification condition</strong>) iff</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Ceteris paribus, Any <em>at least human rational </em>being S<sub>n</sub> would accept the evidence given</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(Non-)evidentiary justification, E, is criticism-free</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">p is true (<strong>truth condition</strong>) iff</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">p is worthy of being asserted (normative operational principle and weak verificationist constraint on assertibility) iff</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">p is consistent with reality (correspondence theory)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">p coheres with a field of relevant beliefs (coherence theory)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">p is pragmatically-constrained (pragmatic theory)</p>

<em>Note: </em>Consider the no-theory theory of truth in the definition of truth.
<h3>Other relevant definitions</h3>
"Objective" =<sub>def</sub> mind-independent

"True for" =<sub>def</sub> believes for oneself (non-knowledge context; idiomatic use of "is true"); more akin to "is genuine" or "prefers" ("That's true for me"--Translation: "I prefer it thus and so").

"Subjective truth" =<sub>def</sub> As is clear by "true for," this term is idiomatic; in some cases it is fruitful to point out that it is <em>a contradiction in terms</em>, if the person means to argue about "truth" in the knowledge-that or knowledge context sense)

"Subjective" =<sub>def</sub> mind-dependent (Whether or not <em>the cat is on the mat </em>is true does not depend purely on the status of my mind or your mind. Thus, there is a class of entities which can be true regardless of the status of one's or anyone's mind. (Refutation to "Global Relativized Truth"; not that anyone really assents to this bogus notion.)

"Inter-subjective" =<sub>def</sub> consensus (not convention or norm or nonvolitional agreement) That we all wear jeans is not an inter-subjective truth (this is a convention or a social norm); that we all more or less accept that <em>the sky is blue</em> makes this proposition an inter-subjective truth (though some of us may not be able to supply a scientifically convincing explanation at any given time).

"Statement" =<sub>def</sub> Stronger than grammatical declarative; or, as the joke goes, grammarians would be omniscient. ("The square root of my dog is pleased" or "The numbers are angry" or "God is a turnip every Wednesday at 8'o clock"--examples of nonsense, they are pseudo-statements, but nevertheless declarative-grammatical.) Record of a fact that stands the test of the logico-grammatical form.

"Proposition" =<sub>def</sub> That which is <em>expressed </em>by the statement. "Il pleut aujourd'hui" and "It is raining today" are both statements which <em>express </em>the proposition that it is raining. "p" in the literature is usually substitutable with logico-grammatical statements, and "p" is called a propositional variable.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I find the concept of contingency to be problematic. We generally hold that other humans, ourselves and the things and events we encounter in normal living to be contingent, or possibly other than they were. We say, "Yes, it was so, but it could have been thus," where in some cases we qualify how it could have been <em>thus, </em>more or less on some intuitive and quick metaphysical gloss.

But my problem is similar to the problematic Hume encountered with the claim that the future must resemble the past, or that the future can be inferred from the past (implict or explicitly held). To justify such a principle or claim you'd have to venture (by some means) to the future to show that the future in fact resembles or logically follows from the past. But to do this, you may have to transgress a few spatiotemporal boundaries, laws, concepts, etc.

So my analogy works this way: Things could have been different, but how might one justify this? Has one ventured to the future to determine that things could have been different? Or to the past to see that given a different situation, a new decision might've been had? But it seems <em>past </em>and <em>situation </em>and <em>difference </em>all make sense under the presumption of contingency as a genuine concept. So it would seem that the expression as manifestation of the concept is equally presupposed by the terms with which I use to lay out my complaint.

But nevertheless, the intuition I have is that the concept so employed requires for its convincing any thinker some intuitve field. We might not say, "It could have been otherwise that X" where the situation recorded by X could be something diametrically opposed or perhaps causally alien to X. A car accident could not have been a baby shower, etc.

And of course no one could <em>know </em>that things could have been otherwises, for one might <em>believe it </em>but justification and truth are lacking. For there's no method to verify (ontologically) what is not, for it is not, and we can only suppose that it is, which can only be a criterial or inductive verification--we end up back at our doorstep. Speaking of the truth of what is not with respect to that it might have been is to speak in terms of pure contradiction. And to justify a falsity, what is not, is to justify no thing but to indirectly, perhaps, confirm what is.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="post_message_56216"><strong>Logical grammar and linguistic grammar</strong>

Declarative statements are subject-predicate statements (or noun-[grammatical-predicate]) which <em>can </em>record facts about the world <em>on their own outside of the belief-context. </em>
<blockquote><strong>Caveat </strong>(non-essential to this post): Though it is not necessary that <em>all </em>declarative statements do this. They simply can. And they are the best candidates <em>to </em>do this. For instance, "Billy is the number 4" is a English grammatico-declarative, but this statement records no fact about the world, given our understanding of the concept of <em>persons </em>and the concept of <em>number. </em>Numbers and numerals are not the same thing. No person could possibly be a number. Though one could dress up like a number, but in that case the person would be <em>dressed up like the symbolic representation of, say, the number 4, </em>which is the numeral "4". This is a marking. <em>Numbers </em>themselves do not <em>exist </em>as such <em>in the world; </em>their corresponding numbers do. I can write twenty number 4s on a piece of papers, but what I would be writing is the <em>numeral </em>that represents the concept of the number. So one could, in a figurative way, <em>be </em>the numberal 4, but one could not, even in a figurative way, <em>be </em>the number 4. An expression or proposition which intimates this notion would be devoid of sense.</blockquote>
Thus, these statements are <em>propositions </em>which can <em>express facts about reality.</em>

<em></em>So, the belief-context is represented by "X believes that ..." or "X believes that p" where "..." and "p" call for propositions (which, again, can express facts about reality).

Naturally, we find ourselves asking, "What is a 'fact'? What is 'reality'?" And, "What does it mean for a proposition to <em>stand on its own?</em>

<em></em>Best to go by examples. Lookit: "This pumpkin pie is good" cannot be a <em>fact </em>because though it is a grammatical statement, its proposition is <em>ambiguous. </em>This should be self-evident. This proposition <em>cannot record a fact. </em>Looking at the predicate ("is good") clearly shows that this statement, though grammatical, does not <em>sufficiently have a sense. </em>And if it were to have a sense, we could still say, "Look: It's too ambiguous. For example, 'This dog is well-trained.' Which dog? What is our standard? etc"

Next: "with all my heart" is obviously not a grammatical statement; so it makes no sense to ask questions about whether it expresses a proposition.

We're looking at propositional-belief and propositional-knowledge. We don't need to look at the conditions under which one might "believe in" the Communist party. We can easily manufacture convincing examples (involving psychology, etc) for <em>why </em>people might be prone to <em>believe in </em>certain objects. This would be unilluminating.

The only category of belief we are concerned with is propositional-belief; belief insofar as it <em>can possibly tend to truth.</em>

<em></em>There's no truth to be had from preferences or conviction. Preferences cannot be true nor can conviction.

In philosophy, we call the <em>possibility of expressing a fact </em>bit the constraints of <em>logical grammar. </em>So, the rule may be expressed thus: <em>After </em>passing <em>linguistic grammar, </em>an expression or (linguistic-grammatical) statement must also meet the requirements of <em>logical grammar </em>which states that the given statement must be capable of expressing a <em>proposition </em>(a thing which expresses a fact about the world, reality, etc). Non-logico-grammatical propositions might be</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">(i) "Bob is hello",
(ii) "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously",
(iii) "jalskjd askldjls skskj" (which just so happens to fail the <em>linguistic grammar test</em>), and (to be cheeky) as far as the logical positivists were concerned:
(iv) "God is omnipotent and all-good" or
(v) "The Absolute is sleeping" or
(vi) "Substance consists of an infinity of attributes" and for physicalists (to make this interesting)
(vii) "X believes that Y" (it has a sense, so it passes both tests) is systematically false or merely coincidentally true if the ascriber does not treat "believes" as a neuronal state of the brain.</div>
<div><strong>One take on belief-that</strong>

One idea I have for a necessary condition for belief is that the content of that belief ("the proposition") be <em>thinkable </em>(as opposed to, say, "X thinks that P"--<em>thinkable </em>seems to presuppose vaguely a normative constraint).
<em>
</em>Thus, we cannot believe contradictions.

So, S believes that P only if "P" is thinkable; by contraposition: If P is not thinkable, then S does not believe that P.

This obviously rules out belief in squared-circles (under a literal meanings and normal grammar). More generally, <em>we cannot believe that </em>where the clause following that is an outright (and confirmed) piece of nonsense.

(1) Sam believes that he saw a squared circle yesterday only if "Sam saw a squared circle yesterday" is thinkable.

By our contraposition, the "thinkable"-part is false (and perhaps necessarily false). Therefore, it follows that the "belief"-part is false.

If the conditional statement itself somehow got 'round the material implication of the "belief"-part being false, we'd either need to (a) readdress our rule about thinkability or (b) the conditional statement itself would be vacuously true (ignoring the thinkability constraint), in which case, we'd still need to determine why <em>thinkability </em>is not a reasonable or relevant constraint.

<strong>Another example by analogy</strong>

Look at my "knowledge definition" example.

S knows P iff
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">S believes P</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">S justifies P</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">P is true</p>

What I've said here about belief is exampled by the knowledge definition.

Suppose S does not believe that P. Can we speak of someone <em>knowing </em>something without <em>believing </em>it? Can someone <em>know </em>a falsity (not in the sense that you know <em>that it is false--</em>this would rather be S knows that ~P). Can someone be said to <em>know </em>something if that person has no justification whatsoever or insufficient justifications?

Thus, one part of knowledge involves, as is evidenced by my questions: S knows P only if S believes P.

By contraposition (and regardless as to the truth-values of the justification-condition and the truth-condition): If S does not believe P, then S does not know P. Thus, S does not know P, regardless of the truth-value of the other two conditions, if S does not believe P.

<strong>A tricky case</strong>

So, a lawyer might justify that the defendant committed the murder, and it might be truth that the defendant committed the murder. But if the lawyer does not believe it, then the lawyer does not know it.

But one would think: If the lawyer can stand up in front of a jury, judge, etc, she certainly <em>must </em>know it. This example is supposed to <em>test </em>our definition of knowledge given (by me).

Try to think of ways in which the definition of knowledge <em>survives this test.</em></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>So subjectivism, even with its unsettling contrast between morality and science, is still not logically committed to producing practical consequences. It cannot even yield the conclusion that we are more solidly justified in <em>having </em>factual beliefs than moral ones; or on more objective ground in pursuing a factual question than pursuing a moral one; or objectively justified in seeking the truth about anything; or in trying to find scientific explanations of phenomena rather than resting content with superstition. For all it gave us was that factual and scientific beliefs were objective; that we should seek factual or scientific beliefs is not itself a factual or scientific belief.

		<title>Constraints on Synecdoche and (Linguistic) Mereology</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 The "ontological commitment" of reductive neuroscience, physicalist neuroscience and eliminative neuroscience viewed as a preoccupation, or semantic inertia, toward a certain conception of linguistic mereology. But the "preoccupation" or the "inertia" is a stumbling. The transgressed part-whole relation between brain and human organism might not be a valid, but is it an intentional error? Is there a "conception" or "conceptual scheme" at all? (Short-handism in neuroscience?) Should we call an abbreviation a "metaphor"? Brain* is an abbreviation for a set of descriptive/physical sentences. But this is not a metaphor: So why is "metaphor" or "analogical extension" or <em>façon de parler</em> ever brought up?

2 Is there an ontological commitment--really?

3 Internal synecdochic field: A part in some cases could never refer to the whole. The morphemic-semantic field may not include its <em>own</em> part, as linguistic entity, as a valid synecdochic input. For instance, "Punctuation stirs the reader" (dependence on what the part is actually capable of doing) but "Clauses stir the reader" (independence of the part); generally: What constitutes a proper part of the whole organism? A proper part for linguistic use? (Are some (synecdochic) uses <em>essentially</em> precluded from, improper to, practice?--Of what essence do we speak here? Social? Normative?)

4 Valid synecdoche versus invalid synecdoche. Again: <em>Automobile</em> / "Smooth wheels!" : "Smooth brakes!" (A forcing upon us to mind our context.)

5 The latter is not invalid as both are proper parts (but an organization of part relations to the whole formulate a <em>hierarchy</em>), though confusing or misleading or linguistic taboo. Of the brain: We consider the brain <em>closer (semantically?)</em> to the volitional, the cognitive, the emotional, the cogitative, the psychical, etc properties. But the kidney? the feet? the toe? the nail? the blood cell? the molecule? etc.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The evidentialist claims that <em>it is irrational or unreasonable to hold a belief that has insufficient evidence.</em>

<em></em>Belief in God is purported to be one such belief that has insufficient or inadequate or poor evidence. (Either there's so much obvious <em>counterevidence </em>or the evidence one has is lacking or one simply dogmatically holds the belief without ever searching for evidence in the first place.)

Rationality and reasonableness are often construed as either <em>intellectual obligations or duties </em>or <em>cognitive faculty.</em>

To be irrational or unreasonable is to ignore or reject your intellectual duty or obligation; or, alternatively, to be irrational or unreasonable is to be in a shoddy or unfortunate cognitive mode or to have a cognitive defect.

<strong>Intellectual Duty as Rationality Claim:</strong> If you have insufficient evidence for your belief, then you ignore your intellectual duty.

<strong>Cognitive Health as Rationality Claim:</strong> If you have insufficient evidence for your belief, then you have some cognitive deficiency. (You might be caught under some illusion or "drugged" or whatever.)

Counter 1:

Intellectual duties are imposed on us by others, standards that we have to meet. I highly doubt there's any reason to suppose that we have intellectual duties insofar as our beliefs in God, etc. What's more, surely one cannot suppose reasonably that we have an intellectual obligation to have evidence for <em>all </em>of our beliefs, particularly those beliefs which the belief in God reasons upon.

Counter 2:

Do you really want to claim religious people (those disposed to believe in God) <em>all </em>have a cognitive defect? (What about theologians and esteemed theistic philosophers and scientists? Wouldn't you at the same time worry that their "defect" bleeds into their other intellectual efforts?)

But what exactly does it mean to be cognitively <em>non-defective? </em>That is, <em>cognitively in working order? </em>This isn't so clear. Ultimately, it seems, you'll have to give some underpinning metaphysical and epistemological account of what <em>cognitively healthy </em>or <em>intellectually up-to-snuff </em>means. But if you're atheistic, you likely already have preoccupations with, and commitments to, metaphysical and epistemological stances about human (working and non-working) cognition. But that's just circular!

<hr />These are all very loose characterizations of Alvin Plantinga's arguments found in "Theism, Atheism, and Rationality".]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Language and the Existence of God</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By teleological combined with analogical reasoning the conclusion of such is professed to show that the existence of God is at least plausible. That there is "design" is self-evident, but <em>design </em>as our author wishes to convey is putatively simple matter of generating a set of <em>captivating </em>and <em>eloquent </em>sentences--plausibility as rhetoric. The teleological argument is tantamount to a jester's performance before a unruly king.

The human mind, in every intellectual endeavor of this sort, efforts to extend language beyond its bounds; jester jigs to save his life. A linguistic device is tried so as to do that which any grammarian of a natural language must forbid, or at least necessarily will forbid. A reminder will be given by the conservative of language, in each of us, that analogy itself is the culprit, and the use of it in such a way is abuse. All that which produces one component of the analogy reduces to one simplified predicate which simply does not fit. And by mereological understanding and stricture, only a grave fallacy can be produced. No design argument shall ever accomplish its task, which is nothing beyond that task of its author to imbue a syllogism with the feeling of some fine day. The design argument is impolite to human experience, and monstrous to our form of linguistic expression. So worthy of esteem is our human power to put thought to pen; we ought not sacrifice the dignity of literature with so idiotic an argument. Language cannot do what is wished, when all that is premise is experience or some awesome feeling. We say, "Language is a devil which suffocates creativity, feeling, the powers within us." But this is nothing but a confusion. Nevertheless, who has stumbled onto a <em>grotesque metaphysic </em>at this point?

The scientific mode, basis for the cosmological argument, can do no better; at least, not without some presupposed metaphysical axiom. It's magical trick which efforts an "ending" where no end is justified by the axiom of inquiry which science cannot shirk. The only thing required to be discovered by the skeptic is the hidden premise, supposing she wishes to play the hunting game at all (and obtain some chair at some school). And that treasure will always conflict with the communalism and ironic conservativism of science. As if the scientists were in the business of preserving their investigative spirit.

The ontological argument is a social error. At which point in the day is it appropriate to give it? If the argument has no place in the social stream, its potency is the effect of pebbles dropping into a tumultuous river. In some regions the argument has weight, but to the extent that it tests human ingenuity of formal language. The ontological mode must need a presupposition of correspondence; its coherence only artificial, which is obvious, in every sense of what it means to be "artificial."

Nominalists charge that "God" is a word which touches nothing. Perhaps it is an empty "vessel"; more grievously, perhaps, a putative vessel. It is a word, which is itself questionable, and nothing more. To which we, in some off-brand realist mode, counter: "A fancy word at that!"

I don't know--all the arguments weigh heavily in, and I can only feel mislead or distraught in the face of them. God, to me, is no object. And if "feelings," "conclusions," "emotions," "wills," "freedoms," "states," "governments," "ends," "purposes," "kingdoms," interesting Greek and Latin words, "fathers," fathers, "persons," "spirits," "deities," "traditions," "collections," "experiences," "abductio explanans," "noumena," "phenomena," "monads," "universes," "wholes," "substances," "absolutes," "ideas," "universals," "notions," "concepts," "forces," superhero pornstars, imaginations, conceptions, dreams, demons, desires, religions, Presidents, "obviously so's" and "self-evidence," warm feelings and kinship, those which must follow from basic beliefs, epistemic foundations, multiplicities, simples or complexes, "waves," "authors," poems, "posits," "algorithmic rhythms grooving across the contours of our universe," and so on, are in <em>some </em>sense objects (at the end of hearing tired qualifications), then God certainly is not referred to, nor even maximally or marginally suggested, by any of them. God isn't "is" nor "was" nor "will be." Vague spiritual hunches and stillborn anecdotes won't do.

God does not fail to have properties, nor does God succeed in doing so; and we do not overcome language (a negativos might like to think), nor do we undermine ourselves with language. All this intellectual posturing is grandly irrelevant, despite the theologian's, the postmodernist's and your grandmother's wailing. From modernism to its downfall, God fits into no conceptual scheme; and nor does God fail to fit.

Perhaps God is manifest from the platitudes of social mediocrity, everyone trying to keep a smile on their hapless faces as they stand before the monster of the other and those myths. "God is the extramundane supervening on the mundane," and even this is an absurd from a gimped sociologist's contortionist act.

Yet we will talk about it, on and on and on. It will <em>make sense </em>as if the whole event of communication on this planet were just some cosmic implicature. And God certainly is not that either.

What position do I call this? Not atheism, for that has become far too theistic, which is just to call it "political." Perhaps I shall call this a quietest mood. I am in the mood of a dogma, and in a dogmatic mood.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Some words on &quot;the&quot; pragmatic theory of truth</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are beliefs true because useful, in that they serve some utility; or useful because they are true? And thus false, on the supposition of utility as implication of truth, because <em>our </em>needs or requirements have not been met. But naturally, <em>if </em>something is true (we can surely suppose this in a "neutral-to-our-pragmatic-definition" sense), we will likely wish to condemn it <em>if </em>(going along with our neutral sense)<em>, </em>additionally, we discover that it serves not our needs or requirements. And if false, but it serves our needs? Are we permitted to speak of falsity <em>outside </em>our definition. From which <em>point of view </em>do we <em>suppose </em>falsity? From the eye of a competing theory? Or in the "objective" sense? It seems that to unlatch theory from our throats so to speak honestly, with clarity from bias, is quite a struggle. We are theory-mongers, whipped but insolent unto ourselves.

What does it mean to call a thing a "utility"? Might something be <em>useful </em>in the objective sense? This seems to be nothing other than the question: Might something be <em>pleasing </em>(say, aesthetically) in the objective sense? A barrier between ourselves and truth will be artificially erected if we accept this pragmatic constraint--constraint as barrier. (How fair should this analogy go for <em>any </em>theory of truth?)

So is this theory in fact no argument for <em>truth </em>as such, but a remark on the perilous state of humanity? Perhaps I speak too extremely and with hyperbole: Is this "theory" something more to the effect of a conclusion parasitic on some or any old sociological survey? <em>Who </em>surveys? How might we validate the truth of this survey independently of its own definition--could we? This seems unlikely. How might we determine the validity of its <em>generalized theory of truth? </em>It's social theory of truth? Seems rather Millian insofar as his inductive account for the concept of number. The concept of truth as a generalization from "the" human condition.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The moral &amp; the logical</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2009/04/12/the-moral-the-logical/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[No logician will accept that a logical proposition, such that "A or B and not both" has justification from the moral sphere. Logical propositions--tautologous, as they are called--could never be justified by some moral viewpoint, nor a religious one. "Conditional proof" preserves validity not on account of some religious text or God's divine command.

But would the tautologies of the moral be properly proven by the justifications of logic? What does it mean to say a moral claim <em>follows? </em>We seem to presume that all language is parasitic on the medium of logic. But is logic a "medium"? The "language of logic" is unfortunate, for logic certainly is no language on its own. It is a set of rules for inference. But what does it mean to be "rule"? Does all language depend on some foundational rule? Here we enter the question of the validity of language-games.

Is the Frege-Geach problem even a problem? It seems to be a problem only if we subordinate the "logic" of moral language to the logic of first-order logic. But what <em>is </em>logic? A <em>logical system </em>is a set of rules which govern the validity of inference. But logic is the study of those <em>putative </em>rules for that system. But is there a Logic wherein all other <em>putative </em>systems reside: moral logic, propositional logic, predicate calculus, modal logic, deontic logic, the logic of economics, policy-making, of romance, essay-writing, English grammar, friendship and dog-training? We say these things can be <em>logical </em>but unto themselves or do they pay respects to first-order logic? Or some Platonic Logic hidden beneath the dashboard of our minds, linked mysterously and philosophically to the Heavens above our scientific heavens? What have we determined when our procedure shows us that something is <em>logical? </em>

Normative versus descriptive logic. The distinction between, perhaps, soundness and validity. Soundness suggests something praiseworthy: We cheer and hurrah for soundness. Yet to claim "validity" seems stand-offish. To claim "invalidty" or "fallacy" seems to either to miss the point or takes us no step further than the invalid argument itself.

Our descriptive logical view point suggests habit or behavior. Perhaps behavior as such is necessary before we can say it is logical. To call it behavior at all seems to imply that there is a logic to it; but do we merely be a "pattern"? Surely our normative view of what it means to reason well is more than merely to commend, "Yes, you have carried out the proper pattern or habit." Well, surely it might be this way, since logic, or those logicians, to declare more accurately, does not give us the values under which we convince, suppose, persuade, etc.

So logic has no "internal truth." It has nothing to say about truth; a theory of truth enters into logic; the logician informs us of its <em>following </em>or <em>obeying </em>rules. <em>Respected </em>rules. But what pushes or compels up to <em>respect </em>them? Has "rationality" to do anything with "truth" or does it have, exhaustively speaking, everything to do with consistency, completeness and coherence? One might be coherent and irrational? Or complete and irrational? Consistently irrationality? I gloss heavily, I'm sure.

So truth is sister to logic; we search for a theory of truth to compliment our logics or our Logic. The binaries of truth give way when we consider statistical study, and so too we introduce a fuzzy logic. But this seems ad hoc with respect to our Logic; I doubt the rag-tag gang of logics truly care. Paraconsistent to Aristotlean/Classical logics have nothing to say about the <em>grades </em>of the world; they're too pure, by fiat of symbology, to worry about correspondance.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The years have worn your favorite bicycle, endearingly but recursively going by the appellation "The Bicycle," into a shoddy ride. Decidedly, since you haven't the excess funds and are keen on budgeting, over the next 100 days (or however many days per part) you replace one part every day on The Bicycle. Along side being economically prudent, you enjoy preserving everything you own, regardless of its quality or worth (which likely explains why you let the bike fall into the state it was in before repair). Sheer existence and at least minor relation to yourself, I suppose, determines essential worth. Hence, you store all the parts, now substituted, in a container.

At the 100 or so day mark, you realize that all the old parts now have new stand ins. The Bike is now <em>numerically </em>another beast--in tip top shape and gleaming. After you take it for a quick spin 'round the block, you feel somewhat guilty and nostalgic. Something is missing; but though content, perhaps even overjoyed with this new ride, you feel that the old must be preserved in some noble and constructed state, rather than tossed and turned, mixed and mashed haphazardly in a crate.

Thus, you rebuild the "old" with the old. (How odd it feels to formulate that sentence; how difficult it is to be <em>clear</em>.) But to which does the <em>name properly </em>apply? The condition for the <em>exact </em>use of a proper name is in question here. Do not say: "<em>Ah yes, clearly qualities ride on the coattail of proper names.</em>" That is not so clear! Which qualities do you have in mind? "Gleaming," "defect"; relation at all? Does our <em>exact </em>use of a proper name hinge on our being intimately related to the object in question? Might I become closely familiar with an item on a conveyor belt and name it affectionately? In jest? But stipulation aside, what are the conditions for <em>exact </em>proper name use?

Aristotle, etc (and I mean this) seem to offer no solution other than the posit of a new category or a distinction of categories. The "solution" becomes definitional. These solutions are answers to the question: <em>Which qualities?</em> (Which is nothing more than the question: <em>Which categories condition our judgment?</em>)

These responses all seem so over-formal, over-pedantic and <em>overcompensating</em>. Frustratingly <em>analytic </em>and <em>bloated.</em>

Quine's employment of, and implicit solution to, the puzzle is highly Wittgensteinian, I think, and much more pleasing, thought-provoking. Tacking on distinctions as solutions and "orders" or "dimensions" builds a "house of cards."

Change the setting of the thought experiment, but preserve the logical feature of the puzzle. And why should we accept the story the way I have presented it or the way Plutarch had presented it as <em>the </em>paradox?

Now we see that <em>if </em>riding The Bike no paradox arises. <em>If </em>at sea there is no paradox to speak of. Enjoy your thought experiment, but do not perpetuate myth; and reject the "necessary feeling" to craft a <em>speculative metaphysic</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Even supposing that there are any, and this we certainly <em>must suppose</em>, for it is possible if not likely that they be hidden from us, an objective truth does not entail that one's procedure in obtaining it is objective. Nothing prevents or precludes the possibility that one <em>may stumble </em>into an objective truth, either at the street corner or in the laboratory or during a passionate and sensual experience. A scientist or a lawyer, in the deep and sweat of their messy profession, may happily admit to you that they <em>aim </em>at an ideal procedure -- if they have the <em>time </em>and <em>energy </em>and <em>capacity </em>to speak sincerely yet intelligibly to you about it at all. This embodies the <em>background </em>of discovery -- what makes <em>discovery </em>in science<em> </em>so awesome, "meaningful." (The suggestion that the <em>world as it actually is </em>is more beautiful and inspiring than we can <em>imagine it.</em>) It <em>is </em>a discovery precisely because <em>it took us this long. </em>And this is what philosophy must lack: We mustn't treat the philosopher as if she we a scientist, toiling away for millennia -- just <em>imagine </em>how shocking her discovery will be! (We must put an end to the conflation of science and philosophy; it is an unfortunate and dangerous picture. Notice: The philosopher will <em>happily </em>describe to you her procedure.) And the scientist?: Ever does the feeling loom that this or that article <em>is </em>the mysterious, not the aim of it, its claim, its hypothesis, its evidence, its conclusion. The <em>procedure, </em>the scientific method behind what is expressed, concerns me. How faulty is the presumpion: If you stand where I stand, and nothing more is required, you will reach my conclusion. (The principle of objectivity: What does it mean to "stand in the same place"?) That we should seek objective truths cannot be of itself an objective truth. (Williams)</span></span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The burdening of proof</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The burden of proof is <em>not</em> a rule of logic. I'm not sure where you could have pulled this idea, or from where it might have originated. One cannot use it to draw inferences. It is a demand that one should not leave the logical rules idle, on the sidelines. It is an imperative that one ought to allow the rules of logic play. As an "ought," it is essentially normative. As normative, it is social. Hence, the burden of proof is a social rule. It is an Academic Platitude the ordinary person takes as a sign of prestige, worth and understanding.

Moreover, since you won't accept any argument from your three headings, you have a constraint on what "evidence" is supposed to mean. This is a (positive) linguistic claim (or rather, a presupposition: it needs to be put on the table). Perhaps you set the burden of proof too high? Or you are too conservative in your level of expected evidence. Clearly you have an implicit expectation of what counts as proof. Is this expectation propositional?

If you could expound upon it, how would you justify <em>it</em>? It is positive, and thus it stands in need of justification. "The burden of proof is thus-and-so." -- What is your evidence for this?

"Substantive reason" reason boils down to what? -- "A reason that pleases me." Of course, outside of your game, the religious person might ask: "Prove it with religious evidence" or "Convince us with spiritual proof" -- Will you call this nonsense? What makes "religious evidence" senseless?

If you hold not to that claim, then perhaps you hold an error theory. Does "religious evidence" systematically make the proposition which it supports false? But is this<em>unfortunate</em>? Perhaps, but you go further: You deem it "irrational."

But what does it mean to be "rational"? Is this a cognitive defect? Or is it an obligation? The former would be an absurd assessment. The latter seems unconvincing, for what is it exactly that is my burden? So I give you a proposition with some support. But why must I do this? Well, the game of rationality can be enjoyable some days, other days not. But what makes me obliged? A need for superiority? Am I obliged to support the proposition or something more? My form of life? etc etc.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Preliminary thoughts: modal properties, identity and time</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1<em> Leibniz's Identity Law:</em> If A and B are identical, then every quality of A will be a quality of B.<em></em>

1.1 ToastOne is a piece of toast at time T1. ToastTwo is ToastOne at time T1+n, where n is any arbitrary length of time.

1.2 Suppose that A and B are identical, then it would follow, by (1), that ToastOne and ToastTwo are qualitatively indiscernible.

1.3 Moreover, if ToastOne and ToastTwo are not qualitatively indiscernible, then, by (1), ToastOne and ToastTwo are not identical.

2 <em>Leibniz's Identity Thesis:</em> If A and B are qualitatively indiscernible, then A and B are identical.

2.1 ToastOne and ToastTwo are qualitatively indiscernible only if ToastOne and ToastTwo are identical.

2.2 It follows, by (2), that if ToastOne and ToastTwo are not identical, then ToastOne and ToastTwo are not qualitatively indiscernible.

2.3 Concern: Modal properties. ToastOne might have been ToastTwo. It seems counterintuitive to say that ToastOne <em>might have been</em> ToastOne. But what of the former statement? ToastTwo might have been ToastOne: What <em>constraints </em>(likely empirical from a naive perspective) make us resistant to accepting this? Further, it seems to make little sense to say that ToastTwo might have been ToastTwo; clearly, it makes no sense to say that ToastTwo might <em>not </em>have been itself (ToastTwo).

2.4 Retrospective: ToastOne <em>will be </em>ToastTwo. What are the truth-conditions for this proposition? Likely they will be empirical-qualitative. (Non-retrospective: We will be making a prediction, of course.)

3 Does "is identical with" presuppose modal properties? ToastOne is necessarily temporally prior to ToastTwo. This seems fair.

3.1 ToastOne might not be ToastTwo; but: ToastTwo might not be ToastOne. Does this amount to: ToastOne might not be itself? ToastTwo necessarily is not ToastOne. ToastOne necessarily is  not ToastOne.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Proposition, the Non-linguistic, Rule</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[1 A proposition is an expression of a relation. The relation is itself the content of the proposition. Moreover, it is a <em>record </em>of a <em>fact: </em>a relational fact. A relation stands under a context. Where there is no context, there is no relation. A proposition is <em>committed</em>. However, the speaker is <em>not, </em>at least not in the same sense of commitment. The speak does nothing beyond the obeying of a rule. The commitment of the proposition follows from the standard of its correct or incorrect application. Propositions are either correct or incorrectly applied, expressed with sense or without sense. A speaker cannot be <em>senseless. </em>

1.1 A sound is not necessarily linguistic. (Indeed, this is an important <em>reminder </em>that we ought to keep with us at all times.) A word insofar, and exhaustively speaking, as it contains a finite concatenation of letters is not linguistic. A letter is a marking. A proposition would be the expression of, or generally speaking, the function of the non-linguistic entity that is the marking. But a proposition requires a propositional space which is just to say, it requires a space for possible standings. Nothing stands related to another thing in this space, but things do <em>fall under </em>some while not others. I do not stand in relation to my self, nor do I stand in relation to my height or "a height." I meet a criteria for being said to "fall under" this or that. But we need not speak of <em>extensions. </em>I need not speak of <em>the set of all those entities of so-and-so height. </em>I am not on a list <em>of sorts </em>or <em>of any sort. </em>There is no <em>list </em>to speak of. I meet the criteria for saying of me that I am so-and-so height. But the <em>criteria </em>are conditioned. Between a man 5 feet in North America and a man 5 feet in South Africa, do each of them fall under the extension of "is five feet tall"? But where would we go to determine this?: The criteria for ascription under the N.A. and S.A. contexts. So is to say "each man here is 5 feet in height", under our extension-speak, the same as saying "each man here is <em>the same height</em>"?

2 From (logically) a genuine proposition, which is a proposition that agrees with the non-linguistic arrangement, to a pseudo-proposition. From a genuine to a genuine. From a pseudo-proposition to a pseudo-proposition. And from a pseudo-proposition to a genuine one. A proposition, generally, <em>agrees </em>with something. What does it mean to <em>agree? </em>And how is "agreement" possible? On what grounds might a thing (a proposition) be said to agree or fail to agree?

3 Every proposition agrees with something agreeable. But <em>to be agreed with </em>and <em>to be agreeable </em>need clarification. Might I make the basis of agreement (our question of possibility supposed affirmatively -- denying dogmatic skepticism) the subject of my proposition? To say that a proposition <em>does agree </em>is to cite some basis. But to ask: Is it nevertheless agreeable? This hints at the skeptical orientation. But what does it presuppose? Does it presuppose the "principle of skepticism": dogmatic skepticism? Is there a principle to speak of?

4 I ask: Is it agreeable? This is to ask: Have you checked the basis for agreement? We must be wary of accidental bases; but to the extent of dogmatic skepticism? Should we never speak for fear of the "global accident" or the Cartesian Demon? How might I <em>discover </em>that I am being universally tricked? What does it mean -- what would it look like -- this "discovery"? (( The construction of a theory versus the creation of a theory. ))]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Intentionality is a term that captures the property of "aboutness" or "directedness" of mental episodes or states. To give some substance to the notion of "state," rather than reducing it to some <em>physical </em>state, the theory of intentionality involves the supposition that a mental state requires an intentional state. Moreover, an intentional state consists of underpinning features which would be, at the same time, underpinning features of a mental state. Therefore, even if a mental state were "reducible" or "identifiable" with a physical brain state, or a neuronal state, then the properties which ground the intentional state would require explanation. If a reductionist <em>methodology </em>or identity <em>theory </em>does not account for these properties, then we can deem them philosophically <em>irrelevant </em>until or unless the general scientific principle is shown to adequately account for these properties.

An intentional state, and thus a mental state, maintains at least three properties (beyond the <em>general </em>property of <em>aboutness</em>). I suggest that these properties answer the questions <em>What does "aboutness" mean?</em> That is, when asked: We should be able to identify, analyze and demonstrate the properties in question. I will here identify them only.

An intentional state, or aboutness, requires an intentional object; this is the <em>target </em>of the direction of the mental episode. The conscious being attends to the intentional object. The object is bare. It is not colored. It is a point. The object is the form. It is objective.

An intentional state, or aboutness, requires an intentional mode; this is the <em>frame </em>of the mental episode. The conscious being attends <em>in virtue of </em>the frame. The frame itself is the <em>way </em>in which the conscious being attends to the target. Psychologists call the frame the "propositional attitude."

An intentional state, or aboutness, requires an intentional content; this is the <em>coloring </em>of the target. The content consists of the angle from which the conscious being attends to the target. Whereas the target is bare, the content is multiplicity. The content is the presentation of the object to the conscious being.]]></content:encoded>

Against the myopic nature of my theoretical
It is my imperative, the after before my is --
Seven days a week I speak it; I step into it
And fall out of it, and stumble back before
Hopeless cautious steps feign to me a way out

Language, a beacon, caresses my tangents
And corrals my sense, grounds my problematics --
I and it didactically careen necessarily into the novel
Nitty gritty world of truth and composure, 'til reposure

a clutter of smiles wrap themselves around his
throat; he breathes through blithely lit passages
of pupils and damaged egos, the scent of gesture
drowns their every attempt at freedom

the dark corner of a bar is the safety of silence
before expression]]></content:encoded>

except this one

"Do you still remember when
we were in love?"
—i mumbled a foolish

myself
she hated that i always

which bleeds into surroundings; attitude
a phoenix found anew each moment; spirit
a bewildering bastion that speaks to the sky

each morning she welcomed me to this
world by her celestial, horrifying glow —
it seared the sin on my skin; and i agreed
with the comedian, a matriarch on my misery

"would you deny me?" -- herein language is
at a loss whereof i whistle of will at the walls;
my heart an atlas cracked and i, with miles
of road to travel, can only belie moral maturity

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have, for the past year or so, only put trivial and pitiable effort into learning the diatonic harmonica. But now I think I have got it (at least blues, anyway). Here's a little <a href="http://blog.nerdfiles.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cheap_little_blues_riff_0_on_big_river_harp_g.mp3">riff</a>. I'd really like to continue study in blues but also learn jazz, bluegrass and folk (of eastern European styles). Let's see where we get in a half year's time.

And this blues scale, come hell or high water, simply must be on the Internet at multiple localities (for those in search):

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From: <a href="http://nigelwarburton.typepad.com/philosophy_bites/2009/05/walter-sinnottarmstrong-on-moral-psychology.html">http://nigelwarburton.typepad.com/philosophy_bites/2009/05/walter-sinnottarmstrong-on-moral-psychology.html</a>

Moral Psychology intuitively defined: study of moral judgment, using the experimental methods of psychology and neuroscience. Moral psychologists study and investigate moral judgment making, not so much moral behavior. Units of evidence include report, survey, questionnaire, etc; these units are correlated with neuronal activity.

Separating philosophy and psychology is virtually impossible, but trends in modern science and philosophy have shown commonality and overlap between methodological tenets and research programs.

Study by Josh Green:
Kantian ethical judgments are popularly associated with rationality and reason (taken to involve deontological or rule-based reasoning, Categorical Imperative, consistency, "logicality,"<em> from duty</em>, etc). Utilitarian ethics are associated with sensibility and sentimentalism. Brain scans show that emotive centers of the brain are more active in making deontological judgments. Areas associated with working memory/application of rules are active when we are involved in utilitarian reasoning, judgment making. Correlation does not imply causation, of course. Moral judgments making is influenced by on the environment (smells around, etc), circumstances (sometimes emotional dispositions, etc).

Some moral judgment are shown to be problematic when dealing with first-, second- and third-person grammatical substitution.

Individual scientists are irrational; though, science as a whole is rational.

Recent developments in moral psychology:
1. Methodological push: Moral neuroscience
2. Diversity of moral judgments (Jonathan Height (emotional process) contra Marc Hauser (computational process)): dealing with different regions of moral judgment; Possible solution: break moral judgments down into "types" or "classes" to parallel the theoretical field or region of moral judgment making. Look for family resemblances, etc.

Explaining away responsibility? "We have some control over our judgments. Not responsible for my judgments, responsible for my actions." Sinnott-Armstrong brings in a dispositional theory to answer the question of "Determinism over Judgment Making." We can go against our judgments; we do not necessarily always act in accordance with our judgments.

"Thought Experiment" analogy drawn out to justify Game Show Ethics.

Sinnott-Armstrong makes a distinction between "the Thought Experiment Lab" and "Real Life"; moreover, that findings in the former do not entail findings of the same kind in the latter.

Legal systems may be made more effective if we investigate moral judgment making behind legal processes.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Spinoza and ontological commitment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Spinoza was a substance monist. To the question: <em>What</em> is there? Spinoza would undoubtedly reply, "That which cannot be conceived except as existing, namely God; moreover, there's only one." All else, for Spinoza, is property of that one underpinning substantive being.

In metaphysics we deal with this question at every possible level or category or context. To hazard a crude example, say we set our vision over a verdant green cast out before us for miles and miles. Within our field of vision, we will identify enumerable happenings, going-ons, to speak loosely and colloquially, events, objects, processes, entities, substantives, properties, to speak technically (under the language of metaphysics).

Spinoza, as a monist, must also be a reductionist. Everything must be reducible, or defined in terms of, the one underlying substance, God. There is, for Spinoza, beneath the family resemblances, essentially disguised, one <em>thing </em>which answers the skeptic of every degree, a philosophical showstopper. Again, that thing is God, a concomitant of an infinity of attributes each of which express an infinite and eternal essence.

All that esoteric talk really runs a mouth-full. What does it amount to in more practical terms? Well, I am really trying to figure that one out. Spinoza would likely, rather than the Realist, turn away from reducing everything to substantives (things, objects) <em>and </em>processes (events, activities). Spinoza held the <em>mode </em>to be the essential manifestation of contingency in reality (or Reality, perhaps). If you want to speak of the contingent matters, the matters of fact, the cats on the mats and the Kings of France, you are getting into talk about the <em>modes </em>of substance.

For us, that just means: the properties of Reality. But we take "property" from the ordinary language all the way down to the speculative-metaphysical tongue. To introduce a model: subjects <em>and </em>objects are properties of substance (say, God or Reality or whatever). So the <em>cat </em>and <em>the mat </em>are properties of something, namely the underpinning reality. Properties, say, like a smile is to a face. We may say mats and cats, in any particular setting, inhere in the world (reality) in the way a smile inheres within a face. The smiling face is not a thing but nor is it an activity or process. The concept of smiling face captures more than its mere physical (substantive and chemical-muscular sequentive) aspect.

But is it merely an event?  Well, it certainly <em>is </em>an event to smile. We certainly smile at this or that time. But is that all we get from the smile? "Event" is a gestalt term. It means very little without qualification. But does "mode" service us any better? Whatever these terms amount to, their acceptance certainly is step away from the ghost chase for <em>real </em>entities whom may <em>correspond</em> to the theoretical posits of our modeling.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Undiscussability of Torture</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2009/07/21/the-undiscussability-of-torture/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The standard approach or question on torture is, to put it in Kantian terms: Do you find torture permissible, obligatory, or impermissible? What are the <em>circumstances</em> under which you may adjust your assessments originally made in these Kantian categories? The presumption is that in doing philosophy we toss about argument which gets us closer just this latter question. If we invite talk of permissibility hinged on circumstance, we also invite, I think tacitly, a never-arising conclusion, at least one we may arrive at propositionally, explicitly, to the question: <em>Is torture just plain impermissible?</em> What I get at is "torture in the abstract."

One might ask you: Do you find torture deplorable? And you may very well respond: Well, what do you <em>mean </em>by torture? This is an invocation of the circumstantial, where "torture" just amounts to some culturally-laden concept -- perhaps a family resemblance concept. However, what warrants, or perhaps what causes, and moreover, what may justify, the initial reflex reaction to the word itself <em>in our culture? </em>The reflex may be best characterized by the quasi-absolutist moral proposition: We all <em>stop </em>at <em>some </em>point<em>.</em> Say, Nobody ever thinks that state mandate slaughter of children once they reach the age of 5 is permissible; or perhaps, Nobody ever finds it obligatory that we murder our wives if they fail to acknowledge a traffic signal as it properly should be acknowledged.

And what is the nature of this "stopping"? Is it <em>moral agreement? </em>What are the differences that we may draw from between <em>refusing </em>to take a position in the realm of these questions and never having been introduced to them. What does it mean to say: These questions are simply <em>off the table. </em>We certainly view some questions as simply irrelevant: Some view philosophical questions as loony and wholly detached from anything important or significant, others have the same outlook on rigorous scientific questions, and so on. It's plain that <em>some </em>questions the answers for which are simply not options for us. Let's say, "I'm not qualified to really give you an answer <em>at all.</em>" And what of <em>moral qualification </em>and just what these analogy may mean.

The typical thought experiment, which is a reflection of some actual cases, is where a commanding officer is given some (possibly false) dilemma wherein that officer must either save numerous lives <em>at the cost</em> of degrading the humanity of a known terrorist.

My position is a newly discovered one extracted from a Podcast by Philosophy Bites with Raimond Gaita. It isn't so much a position which takes a region <em>in </em>the torture debate as it is a meta-ethical position on the activity of debating, thinking about and discussing torture.

The position is a broad one in that it forces one to weigh between the public debate of torture in relation to society overall.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Central claim: </strong>A society is defined in terms of those topics it <em>refuses </em>to see as thinkable or discussable.</p>

And we should be concerned with the shaping we each play a part in of our society. Gaita makes the argument by analogy: Look, we don't see propositions such as "we should consider whether it is a good idea to enslave our entire Hispanic population" or "let's murder every third son" as discussable. For the most part, we passively agree that these propositions are, perhaps, other-worldly. Moreover, they simply don't crop up. However, our comedians and so forth certainly play on these concepts. They're imaginable, sure, but we don't view them as topics on which we even take ourselves to have a position. Asking what our position would be in a, say, mass genocide case would seem like sheer irony or satire.

So there is a set of propositions of which we simply find undiscussable. Now, is "undiscussable" on the same logical footing as "impermissible," "permissible," and "obligatory"? It seems that the latter implicitly grant or presume the validity of talk of the "circumstantial." Even if we rule torture, generally, to be "impermissible" we may not necessarily be resistant to particular cases. But to say that it is undiscussable seems to block entrance to the notion of circumstantial talk. (Do you agree?)

For the most part, positions which affirm these extreme examples sound either morally comical, in that we can only at most laugh at them for their sheer absurdity; or we question the authenticity of the speaker's utterance (we question whether or not he or she is being comical). Centrally, the position here held in this original post is that torture falls into the same set as those "extreme examples."

(I remember in Orwell's essay "Politics and the English Language" that his antidote for eradicating certain forms of taboo or antequated pieces of writing was the recommendation of ridicule. Simply laugh the bad writers out of the position of popularity.)

What Gaita has said resonates with my general meta-ethical outlook. Though, he blends an argument backed by humanistic thinking into it.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Normative claim: </strong>Never let your society reach the point where only "saints" are able to see the humanity in others. Torture should fall under the undiscussable.</p>

Torture, so far as Gaita is concerned, is just one of those questions -- finding it discussable at all -- that tips society into the favor of depriving its denizens of that capacity to, on the whole, see the humanity in others. It reaches a point where, say, we become more dependent on the church as a moral guide, that entity to which we should look to for the right moral perception. But "saint" doesn't necessarily mean a religious concept; rather it presumes a core humanity we all share to pity or perhaps give benevolence without thought of being justified or feeling the need for "philosophical argument." Sure, we're caught in the trend now of seeing torture as discussable, as we do discuss it, but it need not necessarily be this way.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pi <em>has </em>an infinite decimal expansion which may be generated by a rule. What does this mean?

"Pi", the word, is the symbolic representation of both its rule and approximations to the potentially infinite decimal expansion.

That is, the word "Pi", in ordinary mathematical parlance, is used to represent two fundamentally kind of things. Moreover, in a strict logical sense, as it happens, it is a synecdochic term because the "logical entity" which is the concept of Pi (the whole) itself is referred to by the same linguistic item as that which refers to the parts of the concept.

Namely, we refer to "3.14" by the term "Pi" and we refer to "3.14159265 and so on" by the term "Pi." The mathematical description, which is the latter use, should never be mistaken for the former. Moreover, one must bear in mind that it makes no sense to describe that which is in principle imperceptible. Thus, we may as well give up the idea that we are "describing a mathematical entity." Pi is both a substantive: the former use (when it is a finite decimal expansion) and a rule: the latter use (one cannot give the full necessary and sufficient conditions for a rule, as it holds for every possible case; therefore, one cannot give a complete description of it, or rather, one cannot one infer from the substantive case that one as sufficiently described the rule).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nonphilosophers, and even some philosophers, often conflate the idea of "Libertarian Freedom" with "Transcendental Free Will." This is done in such a way that the negative features of political, social, and economic freedoms, involved in the concept of Libertarian Freedom, become mirrored with pseudo-concepts in the transcendental, where political tyrants and market pressures are treated as if they were metaphysical facts-of-the-matter.

One draws the wrong consequence that because we're always under some societal norm or other, this is just like being pinned down by some metaphysical ball and chain. But it must be reminded that a bunch of politicians, for instance, does not equate to some metaphysical fact of reality. Moreover, there's no reason to treat transcendental freedom as if it were something which could be won by popular vote; indeed, it cannot be "won" at all. That is, conversely, there's no reason to "attack it" or "dissent" to it. It isn't a feature of reality in the way a political tyrant or fascist dictator are features of reality.

Largely, this "free will" debate has come about due to an inattentiveness to the demarcations which undergird our everyday language. It is a case where technical terms, or <em>façon de parler</em>, have unfortunately overlapped, and we are left misguided, led astray by, and dueling over terms peculiarly crossed by wire, inherited from antiquated idioms (mental pictures) of the Enlightenment.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pragmatics and the Gatekeepers between language games</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let's first get a clear statement of the position I am taking. It is more so a skeptical question, a position-in-limbo, as it were. I warn you, it may appear to you that I am in search of <em>necessary and sufficient</em> conditions, but I am indeed not. It would be a fool's errand to look for such things between and in language games. Largely, my philosophical method isn't straightforward or "to the point"; I see no reason that it should be. So, this may just come off as a barrage of questioning (many-questions fallacy), but, at the same time, I have no argument to win or prove, but rather a line of inquiry I should wish to explore.

But first, one simple question: Wittgenstein exchanged the picture metaphor for the tool metaphor. As a caricature, and perhaps as sometimes useful, many identify these metaphors as capturing in large part the philosophical orientation of Wittgenstein's Early and Late periods, respectively. Wittgenstein recanted his earlier views, almost immediately, but indeed, it seems as if he stepped from one overarching language game into another: The game wherein one is keen on representation <em>of something</em> and the other wherein one isn't keen on much of anything, but is nevertheless <em>doing something</em> meaningful. Of course, Wittgenstein was always concerned with what he himself was up to and what a representation has to do with what is represented. But he soon realized that he was doing things to his own agenda in virtue of taking up some agenda or other; thus, he realized that he had to investigate exactly what he was doing, or what he could intelligibly say he was doing, as he was doing <em>it</em> (Philosophical Investigations as an introspective fugue on the linguistic pretensions of a foundationalist philosopher interlocked with, perhaps, an anti-foundationalist).

More concretely, Wittgenstein anticipated SJ Gould's "non-overlapping magisteria" and enshrined for a philosophical age the idea of language games or "realms," historically originating in Descartes and his Method (the Realm of Science as opposed to the Realm of the Divine). It's unfortunate that the appellation involves the word "game"; but at the same time that it is so is of utmost significance: People live and die, all the same, for football, and whether one thinks it is silly or not is a misguided question. Calling such behavior "silly," of course, is no attempt to understand it or participate in the game itself. 

Specifically, some of us say: <strong>No look, I'm a scientist, I follow <em>The Method</em> [of my tradition, however far back it goes], I cannot be bothered with religious posits and theory. It <em>obviously</em> doesn't respect my fundamental principle(s).</strong> But this in itself seems artificial to me, and that's about the only argument I can give. Explicitly claiming: "No! They're two separate realms!" sounds similar to rival gangs in a high school shouting that their colors are more fundamental and consistent with their school's pride, supposing they have any, just to wind up the other gang. In one sense, one doesn't really need to stand up on a stage before self-described "atheists" and preach to the choir as if that is some how maintaining the political inertia of their group, as if Richard Dawkins is somehow ensuring that religion doesn't enter the laboratory. Speaking as a philosopher, as he attempts to do, all he could possibly achieve is to leave everything as it proverbially is.

My question/position is related to the shift Wittgenstein underwent, the adjustment or moving away from the picture metaphor. As you may guess, the picture metaphor is perhaps the fundamental principle of science. If you demand of, say, religious language in such a way that is parasitic on the picture metaphor, and you do not realize this, you will simply be begging the question in a very fundamental way. (Where one imperializes on the sense of the word "evidence.")

Now, it seems, Wittgenstein made the jump from one metaphor to another, albeit with much strife and personal grief in his life, but nevertheless he did it in one life. In a sense, he was "secularly born again." <strong>So it seems, such a language game shift is one that occurs <em>within a person</em>.</strong> But yet, we have this concept of "language game" where we attempt to establish it <strong>between persons</strong>. And <em>this</em> is my fundamental question. Can one say of herself: I am of this language game, and so are they: We <em>choose</em> the picture metaphor, whereas the tool metaphor simply is not the basis of our work. (As opposed to sociologists who claim that scientists cannot speak intelligibly of objectivity because they are social entities.)

Wittgenstein warns us to not be fooled by systematicity in language and that we not be presumptive by way of apprehending all grammar as uniform in virtue of surface structure ("distrust of grammar"). Like so, philosopher's like John Austin subsequently lamented the fact that many philosophers presume that all language is in the business of fact-stating. (As if we were all quasi-scientists, as if religious folk were nothing more than low grade lab assistants in need of better training.)

Aside: Is religious language only in the business of fact-stating? And <strong>what</strong> are we doing, as atheists, when we criticize them from the picture metaphor, if we do, as I and I think Wittgensteinian's and ordinary language philosophers claim?

Eh. I suppose there will be a part 2.

		<title>The Anthropological and the Political</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“A society, in part, is defined by those questions of which it refuses to take a position” (Gaita). We may observe a society from two stations: the Anthropological (external) and the Political (internal). These perspectives are such that  we orient ourselves and our investigation of <em>cultural concepts.</em> At bottom we are concerned with the thriving and existence of certain concepts within a culture, whether a concept can be said to be active or passive, explicit or tacit, normative or ignored, etc. (whether a concept can be said to exist within a culture and what exactly this amounts to).

The Anthropologist, or the external view, is concerned with the measure and concrete limits of a concept, the grounds for its application by those to whom the concept is vibrant, active, employed, cognizant, etc. The external view is concerned with the pattern and strict behavior of a concept or set of. Certain conditions are met which ground the successful or unsuccessful application of a concept. Conditions may either be necessary or sufficient, or both. One has successfully applied or used a concept when the sufficient conditions for its application are met. Without question it is unclear that a concept ever is employed <em>sufficiently, </em>or with maximal success. For the most part, pragmatic constraints on conversation <em>determine </em>the meaning of “successful application of a concept.” However, at minimum, it seems to me, the lack of any necessary condition whatever, as explicit or implicit, determines the failure of application. (That is, one is not speaking within the language game of that culture. One may, we might say, be introducing a novel necessary condition or at least proposition a new condition as a candidate to complete or partial sufficiency.) If I say of a cat that <em>it is on a unicorn, </em>it is required of me to be speaking of a thing which meets the condition or set of conditions of cat-hood. At the same time, the preposition’s grounding, the article’s, etc must each lend to the (complete) sufficient condition of the proposition “The cat is on a unicorn.” This proposition has a sense which is grounded by the necessary conditions of its constituents which themselves lend to the first-order necessary conditions of the proposition itself. The constituents’ condition sit at the second-order, or of a lower order generally. We may say that a statement does not record if one of its lower order necessary conditions is not met. So, if “on” does not accord with the actual state of affairs, we may say that the speaker has failed to properly apply the concept “on” and has at the same time failed to acknowledge the <em>actual ground </em>of the appropriate preposition, say “under.”

Questions of this sort may be entertained from the external view. The Anthropologist is concerned with whether speakers successfully or unsuccessfully apply concepts at local contexts, intervals, where, when, why (descriptively).

From the internal perspective or viewpoint, we will be concerned with the correct or incorrect application of  a concept. “Beauty,” by Kant’s standard, was seen as Political in the way I shall describe. The concept of beauty, under Kantian presentation, was seen as, when invoked by a speaker, a candidate of some form. The speaker intends for hearers to agree or to at least consider whether the item, object or artifact in question is <em>by agreement </em>beautiful. We should not say “objectively beautiful.” The speaker is raising the object in question as a candidate for a <em>policy. </em>If two persons consider a thing beautiful, then this bolsters <em>their </em>political weight (as I see it), <em>not </em>the ontological status of the object itself. The objective or subjective nature of the item, this status, is a question of another order. I cannot immediately see what the metaphysical pedigree of an item has to do with two persons in discussion and whether or not they agree on explicit or potentially explicit properties. This is one feature of the internal view with which I am interested: candidacy of an object wherein it might receive a new property. Does “beauty” emerge from an object? Is “beauty” a relation between <em>agreement </em>and the <em>object? </em>That is: Let’s disregard the question of “beauty as related to a subjective state.” Let us regard beauty as a concept which bears a relation to <em>agreements </em>or <em>events of agreement.</em>

More generally, what is the ontological status of <em>agreement? </em>(Ignore questions as to the ontological status of “beautiful objects.”)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A new term need not require a new entity. (Ockham's Razor.) Metaphysicians, as they exist in every discourse, will introduce a sign for the purpose of achieving some explanation; or perhaps to make a description more readily accessible to the learner's mind. A vulgar metaphysician will leave the pupil with a captivating idiom yet a lurch, chaotic ontology. (More questions than answers.)

But we say: <em>That dichotomy does not worry us. Let us mind the </em>utility<em> of the new idiom. </em>In many cases, I believe, the idiom itself is a motivating factor in continuation of a theory or conscious theoretical perspective. (Fetishism of the linguistic; inertia of a cultural property by the unconscious; "elegance" and "simplicity" of a theory.)

We see, then, that Ockham's Razor takes us for a spin. We say to ourselves: <em>Do not exceed the necessary quantity of things</em> while being fascinated with the aesthetic quality of a theory. And if <em>elegance </em>requires a more rich ontology? (Ontological commitment by the viewer-aesthetic.)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mereological nihilism</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2009/08/30/mereological-nihilism/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>If A and B stand in a parthood relation, then A and B compose C.</em> Mereological nihilism denies this for any given set of objects, C1-Cn. Often the nihilist of this sort will make distinctions between types of objects, where justification for those distinctions are in order. Where C1 may be permitted as a composite, or whole, to one brand of nihilism, D1 may be rejected as a non-composite. D1, then, consists of no proper parts insofar as those parts stand in no relation to one another.

Often the argument in defense of mereological nihilism is epistemic. It is claimed that our perceptual faculties (olfactory, visual, etc) are conditioned for perception of composites where composites in fact do not exist. It amounts to a facon de parler our talk of persons, souls, the material, the nonmaterial. Though, I rarely see the nonmaterial under the analytic microscope. Governments, legal systems, theories, treatises, etc. rarely become those which are denied as bearers of proper parts. It is difficult, I suppose, to draw a conclusion that a democratic government, in the way we talk about its composing entities, of citizen-voters and branches or officials, <em>is </em>nothing more than a manner of speaking <em>when </em>we know this already: a conceptual scheme. But I doubt it reasonable to doubt that governments exists; I fail to see that one could take this kind of skepticism very far, beyond the 101 (of chairs and cats on mats).

The object of study, then, for the mereological nihilist seems to consist of the object of study of science. Those mundane macrophysical objects we're in the habit of treating as if composite. The presumption is that only everyday objects are the suspicious beasts.

But persons, propositions, thoughts? How do we support the conclusion that <em>I </em>do not exist? Am I a collection of parts? Presumably at the "critical" level of thinking, I am nothing more than a string of contiguous time slices sewn together by the third-person's untrained (or should I say "metaphysically trained"?)  eye. One question is the import of such a view as nihilism. If it is fact of the human condition that we ease into the perception of composites, then it is a feature of our underpinnings, that which is beneath our language and perhaps our pre-cognitive pretensions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[All too often I see the argument: Suppose there is a law-like relation between Xs and Ys. Where X occurs, Y is guaranteed to occur by law. The laws which are most vivid to us are physical laws. So we say: If you were to input X into Z (the conditions under which the law applies; if its a law, it should manifest as such given or without human involvement), then you get Y. If one inputs X into Z and gets non-Y, then one must deny that one was in possession of a proper X or one must give up that Z (as a set of conditions) are coherent or valid or cohere with the world.

Suppose we put a person into some set of circumstances. In any given case, the person <em>behaves </em>this or that way; at the same time, the person <em>chooses </em>this or that way. The argument holds that a person only has a finite capacity for behavior. Similarly, <em>choice </em>is viewed as a finite capacity, in just the way <em>behavior </em>is viewed as a finite capacity. But this is confused. It abuses the sense of "choice" which carries with it potentiality of a kind very different from behavior. Of course we are wont to say choice has <em>intentionality, </em>where behavior does not. At a very minimum, our ontologies must incur a distinction. But does this warrant the name <em>dualism? </em>

I see this term thrown around so loosely. The denial of psycho-physical laws amounts to <em>dualism? </em>I fail to see that this is the case. Since dualism is an ontological stance, I fail to see how the denial a positive ontological claim amounts to the admittance of a new set within our ontology. If we deny that minds are brains, are we left now with <em>minds </em>under the old conceptual scheme of brains or a new conceptual scheme? The dualist needs to answer the question.For the most part, "dualism" is often paraded on assumption that minds are just an <em>addition </em>to our assumed conceptual scheme. That is, many "dualists" enjoy the latter reception as if having taken it in virtue of vagueness. It's <em>like </em>we're dealing with a unique and exceptional conceptual scheme (dualism), but we're actually presented with monism+n. What's "n"? Well, just about anything whatever. Usually, the "dualist" opts for a shrug of the shoulder or fuzzy feelings.

Saying that <em>two </em>exist while never stating what the second <em>is </em>means that you've permitted into your ontology a region which is mysterious. Vague language perpetuates that mystery. There's no truth behind the I-don't-know-what-but-you-get-what-I-mean; no truth behind appeal to an outright and obviously alien idiom. Really, I should say, it's nonsensical. Somehow the goings-on of <em>physical phenomena </em>give rise to new properties spiritual, unassailable, unanalyzable, ineffable. <em>This </em>is dualism? At least with Descartes we had an straightforward ontological mode of thought. Under these postmodern gimmicks we have <em>uncouth dualism. </em>Dualism which consists of <em>the physical </em>(rigidly defined, yet "infinitely complex") and <em>everything else </em>(vague, yet infinitely complex).
<h2>Grammar of the Same</h2>
I was going to say something about numerical and nonnumerical identity. That's where the "argument" I referred to earlier comes in. There are no psycho-physical laws. Moreover, there are no psychological laws. The conclusion that one would <em>behave</em> the same if put into Z assumes the existence of psychological laws and psycho-physical laws (since the argumentative resources -- the premises -- of the argument hinge on <em>physical </em>assumptions). Looking for psychological properties under the trial and error of experimentation; the faulty assumption is that <em>psychological properties are governed by law. </em>First we must address the question: What is a <em>psychological law? </em>The assumption is that psychological properties are caused by physical properties. This is innocuous, depending on our interpretation of "cause." We could just as easily, and more plausibly, construe "cause" as "provides the necessary conditions for." A cog in the greater machine, if removed, for instance, may very well undermine the machine's goal. So in a sense, the cog does cause the goal to come about. It causes cog X, X causes Y, and transitivity all the way up, if we are permitted to ignore "it"'s cause.

The equivocation is that <em>cause </em>means <em>determines; </em>or that "gives rise to" -- a piece of vague language -- just means <em>determines. </em>One must look from a broader perspective to say that the greater machine determines its effect. From this view, the cog certainly did not determine nor did it determine the greater machine's effect. It played a part, just as with physical properties. My brain states play a part in my psychological "states," whatever these are supposed to mean, but brain states do not <em>determine </em>the latter. My resulting choice to act morally or to be optimistic are not determined by some "lower-order" brain functioning or behavior. In order to prove that it does, we must suppose that "acting morally" and "being optimistic" are properties which conform to some law under a given theory. The whole argument, then, uses what "law" means, on some supposition.

But either there are laws to "acting morally" or there are not. If we say there are not laws, what we are in turn saying is that morality conforms to no regularity. But is <em>being morally consistent </em>the same as <em>appearing to be morally consistent? </em>The laws of morality, on a Kantian perspective, are not laws which are perceptible in the way the laws of physics are. One does not infer their existence in the same way; the properties in one ontology are of a different sort than the other (moral worth, duties versus mundane physical objects). Psychological laws are the same way (beliefs, hopes, etc).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Value relativism, cultural complexity</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2009/09/06/value-relativism-cultural-complexity/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The proposition that "all values are relative" can be judged as either a description or an evaluative. It is usually taken as a justification for tolerance of some value-proposition or normative judgment. "We ought to tolerate rapists" or "Different cultures carry a certain significance relative to our own" presuppose a normative judgment, namely a judgment originated in one's tolerance. Nothing about the "descriptive" aspect of the proposition that all values are relative entails which interpretive position one <em>ought </em>to take within the evaluative aspect.

The descriptive aspect goes without saying. It is no philosophically interesting question <em>whether</em> a set of people, X, hold some value or belief. It is no interesting question whether people <em>here </em>or <em>there </em>believe that <em>this </em>or <em>that </em>thing is of importance. It is similarly uninteresting at what time it is believed and the demarcating conditions of those beliefs. These questions are <em>philosophically uninteresting </em>and are not relevant to the <em>normative </em>aspect of the proposition. The proposition has no compelling force as a normative proposition if it says nothing more than: "Differences!"

So what normative interjection does it make? What about the proposition <em>obliges </em>us to see <em>value </em>in said differences, supposing there are substantial differences to be acknowledged? We may be left with the simpler question of what is a value? What does it mean to hold a value, especially a cross-ethical value such as <em>tolerance? </em>Does such a value even exist, despite its being overtly problematic? Or is it <em>artificial </em>in that only a critical mind may perceive it as valuable? I draw a distinction between the intuitive and the critical moral thinker, much the way R. M. Hare does; moreover, I attach this distinction onto the <em>artificial </em>and the <em>organic. </em>These latter terms are anthropological, heuristic and technical. They draw on the question: What does it mean for a cultural belief, tradition or value <em>to arise? </em>It would seem that <em>tolerance </em>is essential to the coming about of <em>artificial values </em>relative to a cultural. The problematic, however, is just how close to the "intuitive" or the <em>organic </em>of a culture is to the critical moral thinker within that culture. And again, it should be reminded the question of whether tolerance presupposes a critical mind, something distinguished from the intuitive.

I draw a close connection between the organic and the intuitive. The intuitive applies to particular moral thinkers, those who think in terms, or I should say from the internal aspect, of a moral domain. The moral domain itself may be either organic or artificial. A critical moral thinker, or set of, may be that motivating force which gives strength to the artificiality or contrivance of a moral system. What is artificial may be best introduced by examples: legal systems, political parties, aristocracy of varying degrees on various matrices (wealth, esteem, notoriety in sport, in the artistic, etc., the media and fame). The artificial within a culture is that which is easily perceived as recursive, as the <em>unto-itself. </em>We may view, in the States, the media as <em>the unto-itself </em>insofar as its fuel is its audience and its audience in need of it. We may observe it as Spinoza judges a collection: It becomes an <em>unto-itself </em>and as such it is a whole, a quasi-closed system, but nevertheless a closed system inasmuch as it should be treated. Only a pressing but useless skeptic would advance atomic or mereological arguments to the point where it is denied that an <em>unto-itself </em>exists. It may not be <em>justifiable </em>as such, but it certainly exists. On the issue of its justification is that exact issue on which one stands atop the question: What is its value? More generally, what is its relation to the organic of its culture. Should we tolerate <em>unto-themselves? </em>What does it mean to tolerate an <em>unto-itself? </em>Does it require a <em>critical moral thinker </em>to perceive such a thing? Do <em>unto-themselves </em>arises in virtue of critical perception?

Let us draw a distinction between horizontal and vertical tolerance. I say <em>vertical </em>insofar as <em>tolerance may be seen as an internal motivating force for cultural complexity. </em>An existing cultural belief may be seen as tolerable so long as it is <em>internally constrained </em>by some the cultural net of value. <em>Vertical tolerance </em>is the embodiment of that net; it identifies the net in the most general way. Horizontal tolerance allows for the infiltration of other cultures insofar as those cultures bring about complexity.

"All values are relative" must be viewed, at minimum, under these methodological tools: horizontal and vertical tolerance, the organic and the artificial, and the intuitive and critical moral thinker. However, before all of this, one can -- and it may be essential to do this -- expound upon the <em>descriptive </em>and the <em>evaluative </em>aspects of the proposition; namely, on how these aspects logically relate to each another.]]></content:encoded>

With a will like a melody

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Claim:</strong> The propositions <em>Some coffee cups are black</em> and <em>Not all coffee cups are black</em> entail a contradiction when conjoined.

1 ?x(Cx &amp; Bx) P
2 ~?x(Cx ? Bx) P
3 ~?x~(Cx &amp; Bx) 1QE
4 ?x~(Cx ? Bx) 2QE

The important lines are 1 and 4. 4 follows from 2 by quantifier exchange; so, we can ignore line 2. 3 is more complex than 1; so, it won't do us any good. With 1 and 4 we're now left with the question of which shall be first to take an instantiated variable. But in truth, it really does not matter, as for every new existential proposition one must invoke a new name for the entity of that proposition. 1 is about at least one coffee up; we may reformulate it as <em>There is at least one thing that is a coffee cup and is black. </em>It's truth or falsity hinges upon events, states of affairs, etc. If a coffee cup fails to exist, or happens not to exist, then we have a presupposition failure. We may have a nonsense, depending on one's interpretation of linguistic phenomena like failure to successfully refer. These points raise the question of whether existential proposition presuppose the existence of the objects which, by that presupposition, correspond to the expressed terms; and whether they do this in virtue of their <em>form. </em>

2 may be reformulated: <em>It is not the case that [if] it is a coffee cup, [then] it is black. </em>The "it" is sufficiently general enough to grasp the universal scope of the proposition, to give it the "universal claim" status. In most cases we call such claims <em>theorems. </em>Is there any ontological commitment from a theorem? It certainly is not a <em>prediction. </em>In uttering such a claim, one is not suggesting that a coffee cup is likely to be black if it is indeed a coffee cup. One is, rather, picking out a relation between two classes of thing. There is a question of whether an empty class is meaningful; or rather, whether one can meaningfully talk on classes which are known to be empty. The presumption, then, is that whatever class "coffee cup" is, it's at least instantiated by one member; for, why should we even concern ourselves with a discussion that involves an empty class? If the class is uninstantiated, then how far would we get in "checking" the property, namely blackness, against any of its members? Perhaps the intuition that our theorem commits us to at least one object to instantiate the subject term class. However, where does that leave us with the predicate term?

In any event, it's clear by the rules of predicate logic that there is no inconsistency when we conjoin these propositions. If we assume that line 2 must be "meaningful" by having some instantiated class, then we get, naturally, line 4. At line 4, at least, we may quell our worry by acknowledging its existential nature (its outer symbol). The proposition, or theorem, may be meaningful in that it talks about <em>some </em>thing; but, by the rule of logic we must admit that its about some thing <em>other </em>than the existential proposition to which it is connected.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The idea rides on the coat-tail of a Cartesian Skeptical mood. S'pose our brains could be duplicated down to their very corpuscles*. By this all the grammar that grounds our concept of duplication is permitted. Thus, we get to make analogous points which compare trading brains for lunch-money, etc. A brain is nothing more, it seems, than a bargaining chip.

The problem is not with <em>physicalism </em>or <em>materialism, </em>but with the <em>grammar. </em>We inevitably wind up committing ourselves to an flummoxed and tenuous idiom in virtue of viewing a brain as roughly <em>some arbitrary </em>thing, on the one hand, <em>while</em>, in some ways, perhaps for the sake of argument, aiming to preserve the <em>peculiar proximity </em>we intuit or have philosophical pretense to insofar as thinking of each of our own personal<em> </em>brains<em>.</em>

Look at the soul. Is it just some <em>thing </em>that you juggle with? Surely one cannot. It's <em>non-material. </em>So <em>naturally</em> one cannot <em>juggle </em>with one's soul<em> </em>(in <em>any </em>meaningful sense of the term [to juggle]). Well, we all see this is false; for which <em>meaningful senses of the term </em>are relevant given <em>all use in language? </em> I am free to metaphor, am I not? But this question adds complexity to the matter; complexity of which I am not talented enough to wrangle.

Nevertheless, is a brain<em> </em>just <em>some thing</em> that just so happens to <em>mean </em>its possessor? Well, does my brain <em>refer </em>to <em>me, </em>whose brain it is? How can that which constitutes but one of the parts that may complete <em>me</em> be that which also picks me out uniquely? Is it a proper part to begin with? One may certainly identify my having been here or there, given some trace of me which was left. Or, one may infer that I was asleep some time in the recent past, given the relevant or perhaps conventional evidence. But am <em>I </em>identified <em>through </em>my brain in just this way? Is my brain nothing more than a set of contingent properties on which <em>I </em>supervene? The formulaic question is: <em>Can there be a change in me-stuff without a change in my brain-stuff? </em>Those who buy supervenience, under the duo-scheme, affirm that there cannot.

Eh. Enough of this thought.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Windows, I express myself through <a href="http://aptana.com/">Aptana</a> (Aptana is <em>better</em> than Dreamweaver. Take this as in the objective tone; and it's free. So, <strong>stop </strong>using Dreamweaver. I mean it.). On OS X, through <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>. I may consider <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate </a>once I determine a time-inexpensive and unobtrusive FTP workflow.

Buh'really I want to remind myself of this <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/">Zen Coding</a> business. Not that I could forget. I installed it immediately (others covered, beyond Coda, Aptana and TextMate, include WebIDE, TopStyle, NetBeans, Espresso (!), Sublime Text). It's mind-blowingly <em>ow</em>esome.

It allows you to write jazz like this

<code>div&gt;ul.nav&gt;li*5&gt;a:link</code>

to generate a corresponding result of, after a stroke of ALT+E (Aptana/Win) or CTRL+E (Coda):
<pre style="margin: 0; padding: 0;"><code>
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;ul class="nav"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
The list of pre-existing X/HTML snippet shortcuts is massive. Everything from pre-set <code>DOCTYPE</code>s to, well, more of what I showed you above (generating HTML code through CSS-like syntax). Moreover, you can easily encode your own HTML blocks or chunks through an easy-to-follow JavaScript library.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microformats exploits the <code>@class</code> to provide meta-data on the content layer, given some document. What this means is that the<em> content layer</em> and the <em>structural layer</em> are thus conceptually connected through that attribute. One benefit of this is that the <code>@class</code> is part of the core attribute list [<a href="http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/tagpages/attributes/core.htm">1</a>]; so, we as developers need not worry about validation errors that would arise in employing <code>@rel</code> where illegal or the headache of some custom DTD or DTD extension.

But I feel this method is conceptually flawed. I buy into a rough taxonomy found in more recent practices of Web developers &amp;mdash; or "front-end engineers," as we are now coming to be called [<a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200904/professional_front-end_engineering_explained/">2</a>] &amp;mdash; wherein Web design projects are viewed as bearing four major <em>layers</em>:
<ul>
	<li><strong>the content layer</strong>
<ul>
	<li>content writing</li>
	<li>copyrighting</li>
	<li>SEM/SEO writing</li>
	<li>blogging</li>
	<li>meaningful content</li>
	<li>keyword gymnastics</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>the structural layer</strong>
<ul>
	<li>markup (HTML)</li>
	<li>natural SEO</li>
	<li>RDF</li>
	<li>structural semantics*</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>the presentation layer</strong>
<ul>
	<li>isomorphic* CSS</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>the behavorial layer</strong>
<ul>
	<li>JavaScript library</li>
	<li>DOM Scripting (validation, "DHTML", etc)</li>
	<li>JavaScript <em>application</em> or <em>program</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>the data/server layer
<ul>
	<li>Server-side scripts/program</li>
	<li>Database application/model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
On my view, the Microformats method is conceptually flawed. It takes an aspect of the structural layer, namely in its commitment to structural semantics, and employs that aspect (<code>@class</code>) in a purpose outside of its scope, thus mixing up the attribute in the additional commitment to natural SEO/RDF. The attribute, thus, becomes conflicted, confused.
<h3>A problem of conceptual elegance</h3>
I find, as I'm sure any developer would, back-end or front-end, it irritating enough to see <code>class="padding-250"</code>. This description is too literal; inappropriate and under-utilized is that poor attribute. It is, by the structural semanticist of the Web, effectively meaningless. It says nothing more than an inline-style. I find it similarly irritating to see <code>class="widget-object"</code> 20 lines before <code>class="street-address"</code>. Here the <code>@class</code> undertakes both a structural-semantic role and an Microformat/resource-descriptive role. My only real argument is that this is conceptually inelegant, especially since we have <code>@rel</code> and newfangled attributes being popularized by <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.

And true. I may simply have a naive understanding of the relationship between RDFa/eRDF, RDF in general, and Microformats. They may be fighting different battles, where they overlap harmoniously rather than compete. They may be concerned with semantically marking up different kinds of data. But I doubt it. When I see <code>property="vcard:street-address"</code> (RDFa) and <code>class="street-address"</code> (Microformats), I cannot help stop short of the conclusion that each camp has a dog in the meta-data war.
<h3>Getting proscriptive</h3>
It's clear to me that the <code>@class</code> should be strictly used to add richer description, or "micro-description," to the <em>structural layer</em>, not the <em>content layer</em>. If not for the specific purpose I argue for, at least it should be constrained to one purpose. But it's clear by the the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>'s specification of its primary role ("As a style sheet selector") and the intuitive link <code>@class</code> has with the presentation layer, we should opt for no longer employing it in just the way the Microformats method requires.

Granted, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/"><acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym></a> gives it the secondary role: "For general purpose processing by user agents" [<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-class">3</a>]; so, its "scope" is more or less up to the winds. But, for one, this applies to browser manufacturers; I'm addressing development practices. Two, scoping leaves the attribute too "loose," as it doesn't tell us much of anything toward particular non-stylesheet application. That said, I recommend that the attribute only be used as a bridge between the structural and presentation layers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Conceptual Grounding</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Structure of thought (Grammar/Syntax)</li>
	<li>Content of thought (Cognition/Semantics)</li>
	<li>Presentation of thought (Expression/Appearance)</li>
	<li>Behavior of thought (Actuality/Effect; Perlocutionary)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Modal Forms</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Necessity/Contingency (Potentiality/Actuality/Possibility)</li>
	<li>Temporality (Future/Past/Present; more basic: before/now/later/ongoing)</li>
	<li>Existentiality/Universality</li>
</ul>
<h3>Epistemic Forms</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A priori/A posteriori</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linguistic Forms</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Analyticity/Syntheticality</li>
</ul>
<h3>Expositive Forms (Postures)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Descriptive/Explanatory</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pragmatic Forms</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Entailment</li>
	<li>Implicature</li>
	<li>Presupposition</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deflationist Forms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Explorative</li>
<li>Expressive</li>
</ul>
<h3>Speech Acts</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Illocutionary (in)</li>
	<li>Locutionary (of)</li>
	<li>Perlocutionary (by)</li>
</ul>
<h3>(On) Truth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deflationism</li>
<li>Pragmatism</li>
<li>Correspondence</li>
<li>Coherence</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the above, only the Deflationist sits not unsettled and unflinchingly silent at the syntactic construction: 'P' is true iff 'P'; that is to say, no identification of the predicate "true" to some other complex conceptual situation/evaluation is considered.</p>
<p>The point here is greater than merely rejecting that truth is:</p> 
<ul>
<li>(perceived) "effects" [=Pragmatic Theory of Truth (for the rest of my life, henceforth: ToT)] (obviously the assumption here, for jollies: "perception is reality" -- or: what <em>can</em> be perceived is a <em>can</em>didate for the Real -- hur hur;;;;I suppose it's "anthropic reasoning," reverse anthropic? Eh);</li>
<li>mapping to "facts" [=Correspondence ToT] (agents producing from linguistic components propositional senses about the World as Fact, etcetcetcdcs); </li>
<li>or beliefs held in (rational) conformity with some kind of idio-personal epistemic gestalt-web [=Coherence ToT]</li>
</ul>
<p>For the deflationist, it's not merely a matter of denying these substantive thesis on truth, but rather reframing the concept of truth, emphasizing its expressive aspect.</p>

<h3>Values, Normative Principles, Normative Epistemology</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Normative/Descriptive (thinking; and making sense of normativity <em>at </em>varying levels of <em>description </em>of thinking)</li>
	<li>Rationality (acknowledgment of conditions, or grounds, for the reward of "rationality" in the multiplicity of the cultural)</li>
	<li>Justification (internal/external)</li>
	<li>Belief generation/acquisition (ontology of belief/rules that constraint or ground "right belief," the "right to believe")</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inquiry</h3>
What would an a priori necessary proposition look like? A proposition which one knows independent of experience but is necessarily true? What kind of evidence? Does evidence frame truth, or truth evidence? Is any modal proposition]]></content:encoded>

Wherein the glimmer of licentious towns,

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Utilitarianism is a euphemism for being selfish. It sates the "philosopher" who wishes to nurture justification from a manure borne of desire. From this we receive the "higher" and the "lower" in thinking. In a smokescreen we are led to believe that "giving a justification" is in some way connected with pleasure, and pleasure toward our own ends.

As if to say: <em>Well, what else would you have us do? We did not engineer ourselves to have just the desires we do act upon. We may as well account for them and record their occurrence. </em>

Here we see the anthropologist has become seduced by the external culture, into believing in <em>belonging.</em> (Internalization.)

Again: Everyone has a limit, a point to which questioning comes to an end, a moral space. We may see certain undiscussable questions, as I call them, as "moral contradictions." Has anyone ever <em>used</em> a squared-circle in an intelligible sentence? Let us uncover just this feature of geometric and language in morality and language. Let us find moral statements which are <em>undiscussable </em>because <em>morally unintelligible</em>.

I suppose the question, as most relevant, is whether certain kinds of desires or acts should be philosophically defended at all. The utilitarian presupposes a horizontal moral surface, on which to build an edifice of moral worth; whereas the deontologist presupposes that the moral surface has a form, but a stacked one. Looking upwards or downwards, from one's vantage, is nothing more than a quibble.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Analogical powers/proto-scientific linguistic philosophy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In order for one to be able to say of another that a rule has been followed, there must exist the possibility of failing to follow the given rule. (And what this means for saying of oneself that one has obeyed a rule.)

We may be inclined to think that the less concrete, or transparent, the rule, greater is the subjection to possible misapplication. Guidelines and expressed doctrine may be viewed as transparent, for we can <em>see</em> directly their inner spirit. We extract their intention from their markings and interconnections.

A spirit is a logical whole; a whole which demands in virtue of its being complete. May we say that a half-push or a inchoate article <em>moved </em>anything? (But <em>something </em>occurred!)

On the other hand, "moral systems" and cultural underpinnings shunt from this steadfast notion of <em>rule, </em>one on which fables and computation rest with almost equivalent dependency.

We sought for <em>our </em>wholes within <em>stipulated </em>muddy waters; and in stupidity we wonder at why we fail to grasp at a core; or even a morsel of propositional rigidity, that of which we dream while under fugue of rationality. (We draw a connection between <em>stipulation </em>and <em>application</em>.)

DH pushed a thesis which feigns illumination; and it is an old hat: analogy as, or rather <em>is</em> (for sake of irony), the core of cognition. It is warmed over Wittgensteinianism (family resemblance). Moreover, since I am in that all-to-frequent irreverent mood, I should say what I call his approach: concept anthropology. It echoes from the homebase, I feel, of the relativist's philosophical penchant. We <em>must </em>pay more attention to something; let us be agnostic about conclusions -- "but wait, it is forthcoming!" This latter portion, the scare quote, is the fantasy science gambles with.

It <em>is </em>the conclusion: pay attention to the use of words. Wittgenstein thought that we should <em>look</em>, rather than <em>think</em>, about our ourselves, our ways of life, and draw <em>relationships </em>from these findings -- not discoveries proper. These connections establish the meaning of words; the relation between human whole and a syntactic formula.

"Is an analogy a function?" -- and this is nothing more than the pretension of functionalism. For, if we broaden our concept of analogy to include novel, because obscure or <em>unstipulated</em>, cases, then we should expect to <em>force </em>their placement as analogy by way of grounding them as function. (Language is <em>this</em>!) Thus, a "higher analogy" is one with which we readily identify; a "lower analogy" is one which, on this thesis (but I should really say <em>worldview</em>), we do not. But there is the <em>identification of </em>an analogy and the <em>identification with. </em>Analogy with this broad sense requires that we, if critical, ask whether the analogies we identify are in any way connected, in a logical fashion since we are talking on the philosophical, to analogies beneath the surface, as it were; those analogies we identify with. By "identify with" I mean to invoke analogies which are lacking in explicit, propositional form. Of this sort we are constituted as members of a linguistic community.

Picture a being more apt to "retrieve" a memory (make a "connection", draw an analogy in the broad sense) because she hails from <em>community </em>P rather than Q under such-and-such (linguistic) circumstances. (But where do we find P or Q before or behind the neurophysical description?)

In a sense, we identify with our lower levels of "connection-making" in virtue of the analogy. We call suppressed connect-making "analogy"; but in virtue of what? A drawing of a connection between the experience of "making a connection" and one's linguistic practice. To add clarity: from the third person, we are <em>identified by </em>our analogy-making.

I can say of myself: Only I would draw such a connection; but this is vacuous, for only I have the experiences that I have. We are left with the question: What is the content of a subterranean analogy? Have we begun a false departure from dualism with yet another undisclosed admonition to schematization?

A empty conclusion: Words are embedded in our use. In order to <em>discover</em> facts about cognition, we must travel along the fault lines (highways, roadways, wrinkles, folds) of linguistic practice. And then we say: "Language is manifold! Appreciate its complexity!" -- in the face of a science of which we romanticize.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Defense of Zen Coding</title>
		<link>http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2009/11/23/defense-of-zen-coding/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="edit-comment415178">

I disagree with the criticisms that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/">Zen Coding</a>:

(1) adds unnecessary complexity,
(2) will lead developers to ignore semantic principles,
(3) introduces spaghettism and
(4) requires that one learn a new language.

(1) In what way does it add complexity? In terms of output, you’re getting nothing more than what you would have coded by hand anyway. <em>You,</em> as the developer, determine the complexity of your HTML. ZC has no “norms” or “principles” to learn that intrude on existing best practice in HTML. It’s just a shortcut to syntax combination; concatenations on <em>your</em> dime.

(2) Indeed, it is a proto-description language (a mark-up language for a mark-up language, or something more or less close to this). But to call it a mark-up language in any technical or substantial sense would be erroneous commentary; it’s really just hyperbolic. To be a full description language, the shortcuts would have to have meaning in their own right. However, the plugin author has made it clear that ZC purpose is “not to create a new programming language to make you [think about how to write abbreviation].” When you write <em>with </em>ZC, not <em>in</em> ZC, you are still <em>thinking</em> in terms of HTML. One is building an image before one’s mind as to what, say, the structure of the document will ultimately be. ZC helps you get to that conclusion faster. (Why am I arguing for <em>code snippets</em>? In what way does any criticism laid here not also apply to mere use of code snippets?)

If you want to call it a proto-descriptive language, that’s fine. But it’s really just a “post-it note” language. You’re referring to existing HTML syntax only. ZC introduces no constraint on validity. If you want to make invalid mark-up, you can do this with ZC as well. But there’s no such thing as ZC invalidity. All you can do in this vein is fail on syntactic operation. Mark-up languages have validity and semantics. ZC leans on HTML’s validity, and it has no semantics.

(3) This is absurd. <em>You,</em> as the developer, introduce the combinatorial possibilities that ZC makes more easily printable to the screen. There’s only as much spaghetti as <em>your</em> competence, prowess and grace will allow.

(4) Basic arithmetic? CSS? CSS-like syntax is exploded into HTML syntax. Where is the “new language”? And even then, developers are expected to pick up no more than 5 “new to HTML” principles from CSS. Principles that are conceptually ingrained, or at least should be, already (after a sufficient understanding of CSS).

But I do agree: Grouping makes sense. Parent-child relationships presuppose the possibilities of multiple children to one parent. Without this feature, ZC incurs diminished conceptual integrity. It <em>feels</em> wrong, on many occasions, because I have a picture of my desired mark-up before my mind, and without grouping, I am presented an obstacle. Thus, I have to split my ZC string into parts. It’s less than irritating, I’ll admit, but I still think the conceptual argument laid out above has merit. ZC at present does not seem conceptually, or theoretically, pure.

Also, the arguments about RDFa hold no water. RDF and RDF-like languages have their own implementation problems. Once those are sorted out, ZC may likely increase productivity and speed. RDF is time-consuming. ZC saves time by mapping mark-up possibilities to “dynamic post-it notes”, etc etc.</div>]]></content:encoded>

And the following commentary captures the Web Developer spirit of opposition toward IEX.
<div>
<blockquote>instead of focusing on things like: Direct2D and DirectWrite, please focus on better STANDARDS SUPPORT!

Will IE9 support default ECMAScript events instead of stupid IE proprietary ones?

Will it support as much css3 as other browsers do?

Innovation is fine when you aren't so freaking behind on features other browsers have had for 5 years.

Stop innovating until you get IE9 up to speed with CSS, Box model, canvas, SVG, base64, @font-face, etc. Stop trying to create your own APIs before you implement standard ones!

Web developers hate you and recommend other browsers because of this asinine behaviour.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One says of an automobile "this is a beautiful piece of art"; and a common posture becomes lurched, perhaps. Some may quickly interpret this act as a kind of queer metaphor or at best idiomatic. Those less lenient a <em>misunderstanding -- </em>cultural in nature. And to those even less tolerant, something <em>inappropriate </em>or <em>ungrammatical </em>has taken place. And these <em>responses </em>are manifestations of cultural <em>regions </em>within a society. We may call them units for <em>measurement</em>; but how do we identify them? What makes them a <em>measure? </em>

And what makes us assume "that is not what is <em>really </em>meant"? Original intent? Some thematic of a traditionalist programme? (Latent in commonspeakers.)

And the <em>act </em>may occur before a photorealist's work. Might one <em>object? </em>or have the same pretensions against, as one may have toward ready-mades and irony?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Words are loneliness."

A word <em>in</em> its meaning must consist <em>of</em> its infinite application. We suppose, then, that the subject under whose use a word is executed must so to possess an eternal kind of feature inherent to it. We say: "The Subject is a diagonal infinity. A vector multiplicity." The structure of a Subject's consciousness is isomorphic with the physical space of its language. A word is <em>presented </em>as a rampant duality of meaning: therein the physical space, but also within the ground for emergence of the physical space. Let us say that physical space is but a an attribute, part of the Multiple. The structure of Subject's consciousness is an attribute, component to the One. This may be the standard interpretation. We see in the physical space manifestations of the Multiple, but we assume that the physical space exists as an infinite inertia; motivation emerges from the static floor: Power accelerates <em>not </em>en tandem to Motivation, but is a logical representation of the Behavior of Motivation.

Wittgenstein claims of the mathematical proposition that it has a necessary condition of an extra-mathematical criteria. That is, we say <em>of, </em>truly,<em> </em>a mathematical proposition any number of things only if its sense is connected with our finitistic model of the Multiple, granting that therein the concept of the Multiple, we imply the existence of the One.

"A word implies an infinite space" -- but what <em>kind </em>of space? The word is merely a signifier, but we must broaden our notion of such an <em>entity</em>. It is not arbitrary is in <em>presenting, </em>though we may ease into this assumption because we see each signifier as a stage in the becoming of a concept. But our concepts are not arbitrary, especially since metaphorical. The becoming of <em>a </em>word does not entail the becoming of <em>the </em>word. Human use implies meaning. If a word is presented, this will be a stage in the becoming; we will see the word as embodied within a network, a construction (our model). Is <em>the word </em>ever presented?

(Intentional localities: ruled under the multiplicity of semantic structures; whereas the latter are grounded in experiential evental sites (gestalt).)

A primitive is not more fundamental than that which is basic. An experiential gestalt may be seen as primitive, but it has basic physical properties, yet we see the primitive as more fundamental than its properties. What makes us assume this? Must we bear a layer of human experience. (A cognitive mapping: tying a shoe and causal powers.)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Anarchism and Morality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If a thing counts as a proposition, and we see it as such, how much further must we look into the distance to observe its reification? The anarchist towards morality must ask herself the, now self-evident to me, framework-ontological question: Am I noncognitivist about moral propositions? (Simply put: Let us deny that one <em>has a greater wealth</em> (relation and quantification, the scientific) about the moral reality! Let us deny <em>privileged knowledge</em> (authority, the political) by attacking its genealogy! And let us preemptively spoil the earth that may infect us with talk of <em>revelation </em>(the religious)<em>!</em>

If we -- the anarchists -- permit the existence of moral propositions, we subsequently allow the ethicist to ask the loaded question, feigning a grandfatherish, Chomskyan certainty: How could one <em>not </em>stand in relation to the moral proposition? ((There must be some (empirical) reason <em>why </em>one should <em>fail </em>to stand in relation to it.))

(The assumption that the amoralist <em>cannot </em>exist in relation to any moral system.)

So much work has to be put in to unravel such an ontological commitment. It would be a practical argumentative, perhaps methodological, move for anarchists to give up, explicitly, the belief in moral propositions, before any one becomes enshrined in the domains of festival morality.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If I am a self, then who is the other? -- But let us entreat ourselves to the comparative relation between<em> the self </em>and <em>the other. </em>We may view, and we often find ourselves under such a view, our <em>selves </em>in such-and-such a light, or frame, and the <em>other </em>-- <em>through such a frame.</em> Let us invert without pretense the grounds for apprehension of <em>selves. </em>Let us frame<em> </em>each of our <em>selves </em>through the grounding of the other. Is it <em>morally imperative </em>that we do such a thing? Ought I to do it? Or rather, is it an essential feature (a fact) of cognition that the <em>self </em>as bearing the property of a frame at all possesses such a property in virtue of the gateway of the <em>other. </em>This is not merely <em>walking in the others shoes; </em>this is the possibility of the introspective -- in virtue of the possibility of the frame of the <em>other. </em>I may on occasion discover <em>that I have shoes </em>through the corridor of perception of those external to me, <em>others. </em>

"A fact embodies the possibility of thought"; but not <em>a thinking </em>(the objectification analogy). Facts contain, rather, <em>the possibility of thinking, </em>to give grounds for asserting intelligibly that thinking <em>has occurred. </em>We look at <em>grounds </em>and <em>events. </em>A ground is that which much obtain for a fact to exist. But we are flummoxed by the idea of the <em>emergence of facts. </em>Worrisome is the idea that "facts," from an intuitive vantage, were hidden, now no longer concealed: conspicuous to a cultural narrative. (A culture as defined by <em>its facts.</em>) We toss the argument: <em>but the facts may still hitherto remain undisclosed. </em>The presupposition, then, is a potentiation, a strength, toward facts. But we may be motivated, as a culture, toward facts only of which we may "process" or those which reflect <em>grounds. </em>

"Facts revealed are those which emerge from events." But the event stands in what way to a <em>grounding? </em>An event in space: and what kind of space? Our definition of space mutates, and thus commits us to, an understanding of <em>emergence. </em>We may just call this the <em>framing of the facts. </em>Yet this sounds <em>pejorative </em>if not <em>trivial. </em>

"Under <em>your </em>conceptual scheme, the proposition holds" and the multitude of philosophical platitudes. But can one <em>sincerely utter </em>such a thing? Irony is the resultant of such a possibility. And has one explored the movements within a conceptual scheme? (A counterargument.)

We may follow the principles and premises of a scheme, but how does one <em>internalize </em>such a thing? Let us assume that such a thing can be objectified: given contours and on-paper poignancy. We have assume, sure, that a way of life may be jotted down. All possible implementations ground such an image; and has it been transcribed?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Live in fear of a self, but what is there to fear of <em>your </em>self?" -- We picture ourselves embedded within language games, systems wherein entity collide in sometimes rule governed, and in other times chaotic, gestures. The context, when suffocating under the lense of "pure deliberation," one may intuitively posture, is comprehendible, intelligible. The domain of consciousness, moreover, behaves as if rigid, naturalistic. Some abject metaphor conjures within one that one's own <em>self </em>is embedded within an interwoven fabric of intentional activity. <em>That one is embedded </em>in such a thing; that one is a <em>player </em>in such a game. So one drills through the undecidability of a deranged multiplicity -- all the way into, and less likely swept under -- <em>onto </em>a place of conviction. We may say: Conviction, ontological certainty, emerges from the embellished mess of an unreliable word.

From a stratosphere of consciousness -- this is a pretension of the self. Fear is that which is underneath, wherein selves fumble and toil feebly. At the event of introspection one must admit, says the philosopher, as a token of imperative sincerity -- for ingenuity comes from those with a plain face! --: Let me fear what I often assume I <em>cannot</em> be, what <em>cannot </em>flow from within.

The outer and the inner: "An inner process stands in demand of outward criteria." And what makes <em>behavior </em>that criteria? Is this something to which I <em>cannot </em>object? Is it on the same level as "Well, understandably so, everyone has to draw the line somewhere." But the anthropologist hopes to understand us; and thus to objectify us!

We say of a structure: well, there it is (demonstrative gesture, ostensive definition). And then we <em>take metaphor</em> (take sail)! All structures are not isomorphic (as is plain); but they are all alike in that they are <em>structures</em>. Might I call to this concept a <em>family resemblance. </em>But yet we employ it without much effort, in discourse, in education, in casual conversation. Again: might the structured emerge from the nonstructured?<em> Surely, </em>we may say, this is evidenced by the interpretations from evolutionary science. (As domains:) Mind from brain, rationality from desire, sober religion from savage animal, bodily health from microscopic skirmishes, etc. But at one time, we held that <em>women derived from men. </em>Regardless of the <em>truth </em>of the matter, we simply do not <em>buy </em>it anymore: it is morally imperative that one does not. Now how is it that the analogy I've drawn fails on account of the <em>kinds of things at play?</em> My argument, on its face, resembles a form of social constructivism: the <em>kind </em>of the thing is irrelevant; look at how it is <em>structured</em>. The general countercounter: but we mean <em>this </em>by "structure." (A structure devise from transworld considerations, as opposed to by the upper limit of society: a race to the foundation of the stratosphere.)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=":1ed" dir="ltr">On the production <a href="http://reliant.com">site</a>, online marketing added a Flash banner which causes both a CPU leak <em>and </em>a memory leak.</div>
<ul>
	<li>50%-60% CPU usage, 100MB-150MB+ memory usage across all browsers when JavaScript is enabled. Likely due to Adobe's Flash detection library (method <code>AC_FL_RunContent</code>) not playing well within such a messy JS background maelstrom that is for some odd reason called an "architecture." I doubt this problem can be isolated and is idiosyncratic to Adobe's library. But who knows?</li>
	<li>50%-60% CPU usage, 30MB-50MB jumps in memory usage across all browsers when JavaScript is disabled.</li>
</ul>
Don't get me wrong, though. We do have a development team, a development server, a staging server and some others (a development life cycle). It's all very bureaucratic in the "development" circle. Online marketing just decided to skip all that hoi polloi.

Beyond the obvious technical blunders, the Flash banner presents nonselectable text and has no call-to-action (not clickable). It's effectively a billboard, and it takes up 35-40% of the screen's real estate on 1024x768. Usability -- what? Accessibility -- what? Interoperability -- what?

And for some reason, online marketing has claimed that "it is not Flash." Secondary click -- what?

It was not pilot tested. It wasn't tested in development, nor in any of the staging servers. No compatibility testing, or even a precedent of compatibility testing. In truth, the banner came as a surprise Monday morning to just about everyone in the development department (the "development context").

Also, what is that expression on the woman's face? Is she pensive? Confused? Intrigued? By what? What does that copy even mean?
<blockquote>The Promise of Power starts with Reliant Advantage / Choice of plans, easy-to-use tools, best-in-class service, innovation and dedication to the communities we server. / That's The Promise of Power. / That's Reliant Energy.</blockquote>
She's clearly in the passenger seat of a moving vehicle, perhaps nonchalantly cruising through a busy city atmosphere -- sure, plausibly described by an animated bokeh effect. But what does any of that, and her expression, and the scene, have to do with "choice of plans, easy-to-use tools, best-in-class service, innovation and dedication"?

[NOTE: The bokeh lights make sense now that I've seen the rest of their campaign. Beautiful lights at night in virtue of etc etc etc.]

Is her expression s'posed to be the kind that is presumably elicited by such a "promise"? If I made a promise, I would feel as if I were taken as insincere if I brought about <em>that </em>kind of expression.

Perhaps, though, her expression is best described as nondescript, and I suppose from a marketing perspective, if one has to reflect deeply on the connection between copy and visual presentation, then something has gone wrong.

The copy and the visual system of the advertisement are so abstract and hollow in themselves, and together they make no successful connections to one another. And neither the copy nor the presentation give information. My head is filled with empty words and a vacuous situation. Oh, but at least the effects are cool and the woman is corporately attractive.

I am consummately perplexed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By <em>ab esse ad posse valet illatio</em>:
<ol>
	<li><code>If [God exists] and [Evil exists] are both true, then it is possible that [G] and [E] are both true.</code></li>
	<li><code>If [God exists (and) Evil exists] is true, then it is possible that [G (and) E] is true.</code></li>
	<li><code>If [G (and) E] is true, then [G] is true.</code></li>
	<li><code>If [G (and) E] is true, then [E] is true.</code></li>
	<li><code>If [G (and) E] is true, then it is possible that [G] is true.</code></li>
	<li><code>If [G (and) E] is true, then it is possible that [E] is true.</code></li>
</ol>
If [God exists] is true, then [G] is internally logically consistent.
[God exists] implies [It is not the case that God does not exist]. // Two logically consistent statements.
Depending on the definition of "God," such that "X could not create evil" and "X created all things" [God exists] implies [That which created all things and that which could not create evil exists]. // This statement cannot be a record of a fact, as its precludes the modal statement undermines the true of the action picked out by the verb; and the action picked out by the verb implies the negation of the modal statement. The statement is prima facie nonsense (internally logically inconsistent), since it implies that a undescribed entity exists. So far as objects and their descriptions go, to assert that an unrecognized or unidentified or undescribed object exists on basis of a finite set of predicates is to say something similar to "At least one I-don't-know-what exists"; and this is manifestly true, as many things outside of one's experience do exist, but which cannot be described, or could not at the time of the utterance be described. Thus, one invokes the set of unknown entities, and asserts that at least one exists; and so the question is: Must we only assert the existence of just those identifies which we have descriptions for? Well, this question is quite general, and we must come to understand what we mean by "have descriptions for." Naturally this segues into a question about Russellian descriptions. Certainly "the round-square is orange" counts as a grammatical description, and Russell more than less provided to us a philosophical method for distinguishing grammatical and existential descriptions. "The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@~" would fail under both perspectives, and for different reasons. But the philosophical question is: Will we find an intersection between the set of those independent concerns (e.g., picture theory of language).

If "A" is true, then "A" is possible. But if "A" is ungrammatical but true, then is "A" still possible? I s'pose the obvious answer is "yes." But I am in search of an intersection between true statements and grammatical ones: Are linguistic predicates grounded by true states of affairs? I wish to understand the response "That's because you ground all of your predicates in a materialist framework, which is not tenable" to the assertion "You've defined 'God' in a logically inconsistent way."
<ol>
	<li>"The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@~" if, and only if, The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@.
<ol>
	<li>If "The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@~" is true, then The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@~.</li>
	<li>If The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@~ is true, then "The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@~."</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
If "The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@~" is true, then my sufficient explanation as to its truth does not make it true. It is true whether it records a fact about the world; how the world is makes it true. This is why its truth, if it is true, would imply its possibility: under this world, such a state of affairs is possible. And the statement, or proposition, records that state of affairs. Yet, it is clearly ungrammatical: but its "surface grammar" is no indication of its existential directedness: what it points to. But why are we led to believe that <em>grammatical statements</em> tend more so to truth than ungrammatical ones? Well, my hunch is that we in fact don't, and we are, for the most part, consciously concerned with truth, or desire truth, whereas the possibility of truth lies in a kind of grammar. Of course, this is an old hat. One cannot make heads or tails of the statement "The $@#%@##$ is under the ~@~"; and so its truth is out of the question. Now we might ask: what is implied by its truth? With this question we may have hope toward understanding its meaning.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~joelv/Papers/indispensability%20argument.pdf">Why Indispensability is Not an Argument for Mathematical Realism (pdf)</a>
<h2>The Argument</h2>
<blockquote>1. We ought to have ontological commitment to all and only those entities that are indispensable to our best scientific theories.
2. Mathematical objects are indispensable to our best scientific theories.
Therefore,
3. We ought to have ontological commitment to mathematical entities.</blockquote>
Vomit.
<h2>A tiff with fictionalists</h2>
<blockquote>You might think that mathematical existence claims should not be taken at face value claiming instead that when we say “There exists a prime number greater than five we mean something like “In the story of mathematics, there is a prime number greater than five.” Another possibility is that you think that to claim, “There is a set of all prime numbers less than 100” is to claim that “We can construct a set of all the prime numbers less than 100.” Perhaps you think mathematical existence claims are merely consistency claims. In any of these views, or others where mathematical existence claims are not taken at face value, there is no reason to accept Quine’s statement that we should accept as existing what we quantify over and thus no reason to accept the indispensability argument.</blockquote>
<h2>A flagrant analogy</h2>
<blockquote>Someone like Bas van Fraassen who argues that scientific theories need only to be empirically adequate to be our best scientific theories would balk at being obligated to accept hypothetical particles into his ontology; so the analogy to mathematical objects carries no weight. The fact that we should treat mathematical object in the same way we treat physical objects lest we be hypocritical does not lead to the conclusion that we should believe that mathematical objects exist unless you already believe that all of the physical objects quantified over in this way also exist.</blockquote>
Really, taking shelter under scientific pragmatism?
<h2>Naive holism</h2>
<blockquote>Quine’s view on this matter is that the mathematical claims and physical claims are all part of the same theory as a whole and thus get tested, confirmed, or disconfirmed as a whole. This view is called confirmational holism. If you held a different view, for example the view of Elliott Sober, you might think that you only confirm scientific hypotheses when you test them against other hypotheses. The key claim here is that you don’t confirm or disconfirm what is common to all of the hypotheses being tested – in this case, the background mathematics. Thus the mathematics is not being confirmed just because the hypothesis is being confirmed.</blockquote>
I doubt it even makes sense to "confirm the background mathematics" if one means to talk about the whole socio-cultural edifice underpinning one's practice.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Two senses of &quot;meta&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The claim that empirical sciences like physics provides knowledge of ultimate reality is often said to be "metaphysical" in some sense. Such a description seems to obscure more than clarify the topic.
<blockquote><em>The Absolute subsists eternally</em></blockquote>
The above is customarily described as a metaphysical proposition -- a pseudo-proposition, under my personal view, but nevertheless we call it "metaphysical." It presupposes a kind of world and ontology that must be radical or queer to our own, wherein the relations and facts at that world make the proposition true. And it presupposes an "ontological relevancy" axiom which, often with hope, justifies that it has sense at our own world.

In two ways the proposition is "metaphysical," under the first sense we shall treat, in that it bears a fiat ontology, where its terms have no readily accessible synonym in ordinary idiom, and it contains an agenda: the agenda to introduce a novel concept as being relevant to the way we typically organize our perception (relevancy axiom). It is plain that "the Absolute" is not a common or popular term to ordinary linguistic practice, and whether it resides in a genuine semantic family is highly questionable. The speaker aims to introduce, perhaps, a conceptual gestalt, or a wholly novel concept which is not grounded in the ordinary conceptual scheme (that which roughly maps to the ordinary idiom). Moreover, the term is given an exceptional property of "eternal subsistence" which flies in the face of modern physical knowledge, in and of itself. Certainly no empirical science as we understand it comports to such a property.

Nevertheless, the claim stands in some sense, if not literal sense or "empirical sense." As said, we customarily describe it as "metaphysical." It presupposes a kind of world where observation is possible, but such a world is not our own nor is it anything <em>like </em>our own (perhaps because for such a thing to exist, the physical laws would have to be unidentifiable to us). The sense of "meta," thus, suggests the "other-worldly" or the "supernatural." We may say this is one sense of "meta"; it may be contrasted with a descriptive sense which "meta" often takes on in analytical discussions.

Now the question is whether statements like
<blockquote><em>Physics provides knowledge of ultimate reality</em></blockquote>
is a "metaphysical" claim is just the same way, bearing the "supernatural" sense. McTaggart tackles the claim under the assumption that "meta" has a completely or exhaustively descriptive sense. Thus, the above statement, which I think is better described as anthropological or epistemological, is rendered and treated as "metaphysical." So assume there is something called "physics," and it stands in a certain relation to "ultimate reality" -- but in the way that we analyzed the manifest metaphysical statement above, or "metaphysical" in the "other-worldly" sense. And this is where I seem to hit a wall. What makes "physics" a non-term for physicists? Is it because it's "too big," or does the term always carry with it some stipulation that one is "talking about" the whole cultural phenomenon we call "physics"? To put it crudely, does the mere word persistently opt us out of being able to use it with a "physical backing"?

Another point: Would we say "Physics is boring" or "Physics helps us understand the world" are "metaphysical" statements? Certainly these statements cannot be justified in terms of physical evidence alone, and thus they are "outside" of the domain of physics. But again, are they "metaphysical"? Merely because they satisfy an "aboutness" criterion they gain a "metaphysical" status? This seems like an inappropriate use of the term.

With these points I consciously ignore the second term "ultimate reality." McTaggart may say that our latter proposition is a metaphysical claim about physics. But just what makes it "metaphysical"? With the term "physics"? Nothing about this term seems "metaphysical" when taken as a mere identification of a collection of human agents and their undertakings.

What of "ultimate reality"? Well, just what is "ultimate reality"? (We may observe this question in two ways: the kind of thing "ultimate reality" is, a question of its category or, more simply, what constitutes it or what are its features, if it exists.) Is it metaphysical in just the same way "the Absolute" is metaphysical, or "god" perhaps, or "miracles"? We may, I think without disagreement, say that it is vague or bogus. It's a question whether it picks out anything, but is it "metaphysical" on account of its lack of precision? (And thus its lack of clearly and distinctly falling under the scope of physics?)

It seems to beg the queston to claim that the term is "metaphysical" merely because of its fuzzy nature, but what demands that it refer to something "outside" of the realm of physics? Is there a lack of physical evidence for something called "ultimate reality"? It seems that that there's no such thing as physical evidence <em>for</em> such a thing. We may wish to say "There could never be physical evidence for 'ultimate reality.'" But why? It's not obvious to me that such a thing could or could not exist for the same class of reasons which comport to the status of "god," miracles, etc. There is physical evidence which at least makes plausible the disbelief in miracles, but there's no such thing as physical evidence either affirmative or negating to any belief on the status of "ultimate reality." Would "ultimate reality" not be a basic term which picks out <em>some thing </em>on which physical evidence is parasitic? How is "the Absolute" anything like this? Well, if we treat of various monisms, "the Absolute" would be synonymous than "ultimate reality" itself. I struggle to see how the latter proposition is "metaphysical" and not just "about" physics. We could say, then, that physics cannot speak to the proposition simply because physics cannot be in the business of talking about itself. It is not sufficiently generic, like algebra, in its methods, to describe itself.

There is a clear divide, I think, between statements which count as metaphysical on account of "domain exclusion" and, quite differently, on account of identifying "phenomena" contra the physical laws as we understand them.

One sharp contrast that we may bring in is that nothing readily answers to "the Absolute," whereas "Physics" can roughly pick out, say, "the total sum of professionally acting physicists, etc." It should be clear here that we have a dilemma as to which sense the latter statement is or could be metaphysical. It is not obvious that it is "metaphysical" in the way the former statement is, as it isn't patently absurd, with respect to the ordinary conceptual scheme, but at the same time is it the case that being able to "roughly" provide entities, which answer to the latter claim's terms, justifies its not counting as "metaphysical" in the other-worldly sense? That is, is it because we can wrap our minds, as it were, around the claim that it earns a "metaphysical descriptive" status?

Aristotle rendered "metaphysics" as "after the physics," and we take liberties to understand this as "about the physics," "above the physics" -- and today we classify anything supernatural, occult, mysterious or counter to common sensibilities as "metaphysical." It's unfortunate that such a crucial term can be so diversely strung out and used. And this is centrally my concern here. It seems that anyone who takes the latter statement to be "metaphysical" in the sense that its terms stand "above" the physical, anyone who does this must so to give a descriptive attempt to its terms. What is physics? And why does it "stand above" physical investigation (observation)? If taken in the sense that one is merely talking about what physicists engage in on a daily basis its clear that no sin against a logical positivist's sensibility has been committed.

But is <em>talk about physics </em>in the abstract a tip of the hat to <em>the metaphysical?</em> Is ultimate reality an itinerant and aberrant abstraction, or is it something incorporeal and without measurement? In which sense should we take it under such a discussion? <em>Must </em>we take it under both senses?

It is my belief the latter proposition is one whose expression in popular or even obscure scientific literature would be incredibly difficult to find, along with any sufficient cousin. It is without doubt a peculiar thing to say, and it largely has no place, being as general as it is, in "rigorous" scientific discourse. Almost no one would utter it or write it save for a metaphysician, to be sure. But the lack of presence in the scientific literature, or the observation that it is not a "claim of" physics, does not entail that it is "supernatural," whatever this amount to. My point is a subtle one, as we describe "physics" as having some domain and other discourses their own, we tend to think of anything "outside" said domain as being "supernatural." Now, of course, American politics is "outside" of the domain of physics in one sense, though not the "supernatural" one, despite the pagentry, reification, and other-worldly charisma and sway of then and now historic figures. But to speak plainly, we don't think of religious discourse, American politics, legal studies, etc as counting as "supernatural" or "metaphysical" on grounds of their falling outside of the "province" of physics. (Which incites a question that I often find irredeemably inane: Can we "reduce" X to physics, where X is, well, "religion," "legal systems," etc. Perhaps it isn't quite so "irredeemable," but the question often arises with very little scope, precision. At its core, however, and I am pretty heavy-handed about this, I believe it is no more and no less than a conceptual blunder.) They're simply not about the subject; moreover, and as a brief justification for my own interpretation of the latter proposition, anthropological or epistemological claims about scientific discourse are not "metaphysical" in the "other-worldly" sense. We may call them "non-physical," which is what I think McTaggart likely meant.

The concepts of "domain" and "province" become fuzzy here since, on McTaggart's view, it seems that all statements "about" physics are metaphysical, as if talking "about physics" and talking "about the Absolute" amount to the same kind of judgment.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>What hostility to the richness of programming! To try to reduce it to something straightforward and predictable, to place a taboo on all the weird and beautiful programs. The landscape of programming techniques is enormous, fascinating in its diversity, still largely unexplored. It is certainly littered with traps and snares, luring the inexperienced programmer into all kinds of horrible mistakes, but that only means you should proceed with caution, keep your wits about you. As you learn, there will always be new challenges, new territory to explore. The programmer who refuses to keep exploring will surely stagnate, forget his joy, lose the will to program (and become a manager).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I came across some quirky looking <a href="http://snipplr.com/view.php?codeview&amp;id=29603">code</a> on <a href="http://snipplr.com">snipplr.com</a>, to the effect:
<pre>(function(a) {
    return a();
})(<span style="color: #cc99ff;">{</span>
    foo: function() {
        return "I'm magical!";
    },
    bar: function() {
        return "Well, I disagree!";
    }
<span style="color: #cc99ff;">}</span>.<span style="color: #99cc00;">foo</span>);</pre>
What's more, but which generally throws an error (varies depending on your UA):
<pre>setTimeout({
    run: (function(foo) {
        var bar = foo();
        return bar;
    })(function() { return "me!" })
}.run, 1000);</pre>
I guess I'm a bit late. This language feature is often used, it is commonly understood, to initialize complex arrays.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>"Meaning is use"</h2>
<blockquote>It is quite clear that here Wittgenstein is <em>not</em> offering the general theory that “meaning is use,” as he is sometimes interpreted as doing. The main rival views that Wittgenstein warns against are that the meaning of a word is some object that it names–in which case the meaning of a word could be destroyed, stolen or locked away, which is nonsense–and that the meaning of a word is some psychological feeling–in which case each user of a word could mean something different by it, having a different feeling, and communication would be difficult if not impossible.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Language as representation and language as function: repeatedly we run against these walls. A conceptual antagonism exists between these two definitions of language, as has been demonstrated in discourse philosophic, theologic, scientific, politics, etc. For my mind, and perhaps to my detriment as a Student of philosophy, I am constantly reeled in by Wittgenstein's most generic internal struggle: the harmonization of the two primal metaphors by which we understand language to exist, either as a picture, or collection of, or as a tool, etc. More abstract but more contentious, ultimately, is the claim that this or that deity is or basically amounts to a thing, like any other, with a name, just as any other, than whether <em>it </em>is a man. But in truth, which is more basic to human concern? We may say, in opposition to the inquiry into the presumably more important metaphysical-object status of the deity, for instance: <em>But whatever a man amounts to physically, there persists all the nonphysical properties of </em>this <em>or </em>that <em>gender which most adequately captures the essential nature of the deity. </em>Quickly, we should see that such a counterpoint invokes the notion of <em>telos, </em>purpose, function, and so forth, as it is clear that when I declare, however archaic: "Man is the measure of all things," I mean nothing about the physical properties of this or that man as rule for measurement to the expanse of reality, nor, what's more, man as a biological animal. Indeed, <em>in god's image </em>is a phrasing which troubles many for just the reason that the image of man is itself difficult to fathom: yet we possess so many garden variety, prototypical demonstrations of what <em>counts as an image, </em>and metaphorical images speak nothing but danger, as only a kind of talent, it may be said, might <em>count </em>them faithfully and judiciously

...

The conceptual landscape out from which ordinary-down-to-technical-up-to-mystical speakers of a language apply concepts is a primary subject matter in philosophy of language. We may look at the myriad, sometimes confused, other times aright, forms of representation, the ontological backdrop of linguistic activity, or we may observe the effectual characteristics of performances we commonly describe as linguistic. We may investigation the distinctions and overlapping between fact-stating language (constative) and value-implying language (performantive); I say value-implying to appease the anthropologist whose task it is to uncover and reveal the cultural and historical underpinnings of speakers, archetype <em>and </em>peculiar.

<em>I'm terribly sorry for what I have done. </em>And <em>why</em> apologize in <em>this </em>setting, we might enquire? Or more generally, what is the connection between the concept of forgiveness (and anticipated mercy), relative to a culture, and the language with which its members express said concept. Nevertheless, values are latent, most clearly, in performative utterances, for values are the reason for which a performatives emerge: they are necessary posits so as to explain such behavior.

We, moreover, look at the pitfalls and paradoxes engendered by (apparent) concept mix-matching, wherein interpretation of an utterance fails to clearly demarcate the conceptual inner-workings of one speech act now performative, now constative and everywhere in between. Indeed, it is not clear that a description (a statement, say, of scientific propositions or -- hopefully -- precise and methodologically grounded contingent propositions) <em>always fails </em>to possess a value, even an implicit one. Thus, we may see that an organization of

1. performative always and only implies value
2. constative always and only implies fact

which is highly contentious. But even then, this is a rudimentary starting point for my ruminations on this matter. Clearly these components ought not to be taken as gospel. The intuition, I gather, is that this is how one may typically view such cumbersome terms. So sure, indeed, a performative may be viewed as a mere behavior of a kind, and eager are we to classify it under those terms. A kind of associationism looms behind the methods in which performatives are treated. In a sense, performatives are linguistic <em>behavior, </em>and not the other way around; whereas the presumption, conversely, holds that constatives are chiefly and properly expressions of language. So further, one may assume that <em>language </em>is better understood in terms of the concept which acts as root to constative forms of speech; i.e., language as representation.

We start of inquiry into the structural or logical tethers of language by observing its objects, artefacts, things and stuffs, where every noun a noun, every verb a noun -- a world of substantives and relations (which are just as well things but on a more abstract level). Readily we see the unfit nature of such a conceptual if applied to the notion of performative utterance and behavior so defined in those terms. Immediately we must observe and respect the psychical world and its denizens, motivations, agendas, goals, ideas (not as idealizations), laws (hardly describable, if at all, as nomic, but as moral or imperative): the mental. How might we connect the performative we the mental? Indeed, one may perform an action which some arbitrary linguistic behavior -- but why should she, or he? And why at this very moment? Granted, to be sure, these agents speak about this or that, and intentions are abound, inundating our skulls we philosophically trivial substitutable terms, but have we more to say than S stands in a certain [psychical] relation to P?

(I should add some points about "criteria" and "process.")]]></content:encoded>

This is what happens when one <em>knows HTML</em>. Not only is this block of code a semanticist's nightmare, but the original developer was compelled to accept false dilemmas, thus tripping into a practice of abusing two other languages (JSP and JavaScript).

Honestly, I'm not the sharpest butterfly knife in the poke, but I find it hard to believe the developer who wrote this code has the intuition to <em>avert complexity</em>. But such an intuition (or talent) <em>must be </em>a common feature of human intelligence: "There just <em>has to be an easier way</em>" or "What the fuckballs am I doing?" -- apparently not.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Methods</h2>
<ol>
	<li>How often do you comment your code? Do you have a particular schema for annotation?</li>
	<li>Purist versus hacker dilemma: How do you address this general problem? At the end of the day, Internet Explorer 6 reigns.</li>
	<li>What is the Separation of Concerns? How do you organize the resources (JS, CSS, Images, Templates, etc.) for a Web project?</li>
</ol>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<ol>
	<li>What is a doctype (DTD)? And what are some consequences of not declaring a doctype? <em> Answer:</em> If the mime-type of the document qualifies as "text/html," a doctype informs the user agent of which set of elements should exist for the following HTML document. Thus, for the CSS engine and JavaScript interpreter in that browser, elements can be said to "exist" depending on the declarations within the document type definition. Within the ontology of web browsers, there exist two kinds of entities: elements (objects) and [their] attributes; for any HTML document, the domain of discourse is defined by the document type: which elements exist and which attributes they can possibly possess. For true-XML documents, whose mime-type is application/xml or application/xhtml, since XML is "extreme" -- whups: "extensible" -- the domain of discourse is "up for grabs," since XML's semantic-ontology is almost completely nil. Doctypes also trigger, under the web browser context, the designated rendering mode: quirks, almost standards, and standards mode. (Never, ever, ever, ever, design in quirks mode.</li>
	<li>Are you familiar with HTML5? Describe a possible scenario in which one might declare its doctype.</li>
	<li>What do Web standards mean to you?</li>
	<li>List one advantage and one disadvantage of using line-breaks (&lt;br /&gt;).</li>
	<li>There are two types of XHTML, "marketing XHTML" and "real XHTML". What's the difference? <em>Answer:</em> The former describes a Web document transmitted using the text/html mime-type, whereas the latter describes an XHTML document which is transmitted using the application/xml or application/xhtml mime-types.</li>
	<li>What's the difference between a tag and an element?</li>
	<li>What are attributes?</li>
	<li>How would you mark up a physical address?</li>
	<li>What is the difference between a block- and inline-level element?</li>
</ol>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<ol>
	<li>What is the difference between graceful degradation and progressive enhancement?</li>
	<li>What is the DOM? And what do doctypes and the DOM have to do with one another?</li>
	<li>How would you implement a lightbox or JS modal window?</li>
	<li>Compare and contrast innerHTML and appendChild.</li>
	<li>How does one traverse the DOM relative to a &lt;form id="form_id"&gt;?</li>
	<li>What's wrong with Array.sort()?</li>
	<li>How does one extend the native String object such that function Funky can be invoked for any arbitrary string? <em> Answer:</em> <code>String.prototype.Funky = function() { //... };</code></li>
	<li>What's wrong with the follow line? <code>var o = { attr1: "", 2attr: function() { return 2; }(), _attr3: [], };</code></li>
	<li>What's the difference between the comparison operators == and ===?</li>
	<li>When should one include an external JavaScript file in the ?</li>
	<li>What are some best practices for traversing the DOM?</li>
	<li>What are best practices when dealing with performance? (HTTP requests, ensure server-side compression, etc)</li>
	<li>What is the primary difference between IE and Firefox's rendering engines?</li>
	<li>What is Just-In-Time compilation?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Browsers</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Which web browsers do you develop in?</li>
	<li>Which web browsers do you test in?</li>
	<li>What is content negotiation?</li>
	<li>Tell me the strangest thing you've seen IE do.</li>
	<li>Which web browser is your favorite?</li>
	<li>Which typeface looks better, Helvetica or Arial?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Which tools do you use daily?</li>
	<li>How do you debug JavaScript?</li>
	<li>What's your favorite IDE or code editor?</li>
</ol>
<h2><abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr></h2>
<ol>
	<li>What are keywords and are they important?</li>
	<li>What are the most important elements of an HTML document's body?</li>
	<li>What is the most important element in the &lt;head&gt;?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<ol>
	<li>What is web accessibility?</li>
	<li>How do you feel about browser targetting?</li>
	<li>Are you familiar with sIFR?</li>
</ol>
<h2><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></h2>
<ol>
	<li>Do you like to organize your CSS in a particular way?</li>
	<li>What is a CSS Sprite?</li>
	<li>Do you prefer CSS hacks or keeping IE separate?</li>
	<li>What are font stacks? And how do you deal with font sizes?</li>
	<li>How would you center a &lt;div&gt; to a page, both vertically and horizontally?</li>
	<li>How would you pull off rounded corners?</li>
	<li>Do you still use tables for forms?</li>
	<li>Equal-height columns -- what do you do?</li>
	<li>Define the box models.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>First Act</h2>
<dl> <dt>Primitive Man</dt> <dd>(<em>Points ostensibly to a mundane stone situated before him.</em>) One!</dd> <dt>Primitive Man</dt> <dd>(<em>Again.</em>) One!</dd> <dt>Primitive Man</dt> <dd>(<em>Again</em>; followed by extended sigh.) One! ...</dd> <dt>Primitive Man</dt> <dd><em>He begins to sulk and wail as if the act were a kind of superstitious ritual. He begins to dance, cajoled by the stone's physical presence.</em></dd> <dt>Primitive Man</dt> <dd>One! One! One! One! ...</dd> <dt>Primitive Man</dt> <dd><em>He stands dejected and immoral by his unsuccessful attempts. Rain shall not fall this season.</em></dd> </dl>Our Primitive Man undertook a rain dance, say, so as to fruitfully introduce a new term into his language. His attempt, as given our scene, was a failure. But as he begins to stomp away from his alter, fire, what have you, he murmurs to himself as he paces. "One... One... One..."; he is "counting" his feet, as is clear, but he continuously, consistently fails (as he did before; he might now say: <em>the set of his walking consisted in</em>) -- though the point here is that he is not celebrating in this act. It is a mere transition to another game. (Imagine, if you can, pacing as a game we play. And why is it not? Indeed, what makes this behavior not counting? -- Do not say: "Well, obviously!" That is to say, I have generated a question, and if understood by any intellect, an answer must be given (we seek to, or rather are compelled to (theorem: psychologically), extend our epistemic rights.)
<h2>Second Act</h2>
<dl> <dt>Musical Man</dt> <dd>Dun. Dun. Dun. Dun. Dun.</dd> <dt>Musical Man</dt> <dd>(<em>Notice of a rhythm to his counting.</em>)</dd> </dl>Theory on correspondence theory of truth:
<blockquote>Music as a Representation of the World.</blockquote>
Consider the score a picture of reality in the "literal," physical sense; music as a description of the empirical world, -- now the mathematical world. Do not consider
<blockquote>Music as a Creation of the World.</blockquote>
We imagine music as a complexity, but is it, like with mathematics, necessarily not about the world? Would we say that music is an application of mathematics? Perhaps even founded on mathematics?

Devil's enquiry: "The world created by a musical piece. What sense of world do we use here? <em>Must</em> it map to our understanding of world in the physical sense, world in the mathematical sense? Can we make sense of the question? Can we make sense of the use in ordinary language? (Will we resort to a psycho-causal theory to explain this phenomenon in ordinary language? Thus!: the sense of the question is best understood under the frame of the physical. But is the musical world created an approximation to our empirical world, or is it the Unto Itself, like how we view the world of the physical (the Natural world) or the mathematical (the world of Necessity)?
<h2>Third Act</h2>
(Rain fails -- the man enjoys the Real-ality: observation of real numbers through a waterfall. Quickly: might one continue to bellow out: "One!"?)
<h2>Fourth Act</h2>
We are those caught in the rain,
Unable to embrace its insanity,
For our lack of language:
Language as a Necessity
To the Possibility of Sensation;
Of Seers See No Truth]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<code>
(P) You like X for X's Q.
(1) -&gt; You [only] like X for X's Q, and no other property Z of X interests you.
(2) -&gt; It is possible that you like X for X's Q.
(3) -&gt; It is possible that you [only] like X for X's Q "
</code>

(2) and (3) are trivially true, and a speaker would have no motivation to assert it. It is practically irrelevant, and moreover would only suggestion shared sentiment between the speaker and the inquirer. Inquirer should only consider questions of the reasons behind (1). The speaker may be justified or unjustified in asserting (1), insofar as the speaker can be said to [know] (1). The crux of the problem here is whether (P) counts as knowledge, or if the speaker merely wishes to pass off (2) and (3) with the overt form of (1), supposing (P) properly translates to (1). (I want to consider: The speaker thinks to him or herself in asserting (P): "Let's pretend that I know something substantial, but in truth, I have no relevant knowledge on the matter, but my language makes it look as though I do.")

If the speaker has knowledge, then the speaker should be scrutinized insofar as that knowledge, where the inquirier is interested only in the speaker's evidence for (1). If the speaker merely wishes to insult or criticize from bias, then the speaker may employ (2) or (3), but if the speaker wishes to speak truly, even if the speaker may fail to do so, then the speaker may employ (P) or (1). If the speaker has no knowledge, or even further, no evidence, then the speaker counts as only <em>semantically capable </em>to genuinely assert (2) or (3). (Measure the conceptual utility of the new concept: "semantic capability," or "semantic rights" -- what we have a right to mean; or more generally "semantic laws." I fear "the semantic string" is of utmost relevance here.)

If the speaker has knowledge or evidence, then evidence is what is relevant. Hunches, guesses, suppositions, mere belief, pure emotional expression which happens to take on the form of language (belting out "ow!" after stubbing one's toe), and so on, all should take treatment as if (2) or (3). Mere belief, for instance, gives you nothing to analyze in terms of justification, reason or evidence; thus, utterances of this sort are effectively equivalent to (2) or (3). "Justificatory content," so to say, in such a case, fails to exist; but this is not to say that the statement is meaningless or generally unanalyzable. This is only to say that in terms of the analysis of knowledge, our practice will inevitably fall flat, so long as we keep to a narrow definition of knowledge such that it is defined in terms of justified true belief.

A purely psychological or emotional analysis may be in order, which appeals to the causal mechanisms of the brain and its neural inner-workings. This analysis may be consistent with our "procedure to the justificatory"; but it cannot overwrite or undermine it, without introducing harm to the ways we, in the most generic conceptual manner, treat of human behavior at the level of the mental (i.e., propositional, reason-based, etc). All this is to say: reasoned (linguistic) behavior may overlap or run in parallel to mere causal events, but both kinds of phenomena, insofar as the analysis applied, must equally be given at least a "parallel" treatment.

Analysis and interpretation must respect categorical dissimilarity (when we speak of categories, we must always "look upward" in our minds to common descent: can the thing in question have mutually excluding parents; of which the thing in question, given the contextualization of our analysis -- *or "for our purposes" --, cannot -- *or should not -- bear entailment properties in virtue of being child to one or some other intuitively plausible parent), insofar as one phenomenon may count as a member of categories non-intersecting. We may do this, I believe, without being labelled "dualists," for this is a analytical method which commits one to no metaphysical parent narrative. The analyst, it is my belief, has no story to tell, but only one to uncover which speaks faithfully to most generally justifiable intellectual intuition.

As usual the criticism may arise that this approach is too "pedantic," overly dry, or whatever; the general spirit of such a criticism is that it treats so cautiously as to become careless the heart of language and its use. But I feel this criticism is ill-founded, for it ignores the outset interest of our undertaking: to go our of our way, on the assumption that it exists, to investigate language as a picture. Indeed, the owner of such a critique cannot assert as if obvious that language never grounds from a picture, or that images in language and from which language may emerge never exist. Naturally, our approach assumes a "metaphorical assumption" that language [is] in some cases chiefly image-grounded, and this assumption should be said to stand or fall given its conceptual utility (which is a cumbersome way of saying that it <em>makes sense </em>so long as one is attentive). That the conceptual space of language holds a region purely of images, I think, is debatable; whereas the belief that <em>all </em>language amounts to images and their expression is clearly not justifiable (but this is another debate which centers on the status of private languages). Naturally, again, we can go on for quite a spell backwards into the conceptual underpinnings of <em>our </em>conceptual history. I choose to end here, for all this amounts to typical digression that can trap anyone.

So, perhaps more succinctly, I should say: I aim to understand what assertions mean, and the approach given above, which is tethered to the <em>popular definition of knowledge</em>, is my effort to understand. Whether it is wholly unfruitful, I believe is a matter of preference, and I should not ever demand that others engage it. Assertions amount to pictures whose brush strokes come from the bristles of justification and whose directions analogous to the lines of right thinking, conspicuous or obscure. I perceive never obstruction of sense, but only the fog of language, should such a fog compel me to unmanageable thought: I shall aim ever to understand what I mean before I say it, only so when I venture to craft from the world rather than create into the world.

And I end with the basis for my albeit archaic way of thinking:
<blockquote>I have laboured carefully, not to mock, lament, or execrate, but to understand human actions; and to this end I have looked upon passions, such as love, hatred, anger, envy, ambition, pity, and the other perturbations of the mind, not in the light of vices of human nature, but as properties, just as pertinent to it, as are heat, cold, storm, thunder, and the like to the nature of the atmosphere, which phenomena, though inconvenient, are yet necessary, and have fixed causes, by means of which we endeavour to understand their nature, and the mind has just as much pleasure in viewing them aright, as in knowing such things as flatter the senses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Exploration of philosophical suicide. I seek not to justify the statement: <em>I desire to commit suicide</em>, but rather: <em>I desire to understand whether I must commit suicide</em>. One interpretation of the target statement is such that one may view one's own life as a <em>mistake </em>of a certain sort: the metaphysical sort. No one could possibly determine that the laws of nature, or that nature itself, underwent error; and even if this were the case, no palpable justification should emerge, for nothing about nature justifies or carries a certain logical conclusion. The mistake, then, would be such that one's continued presence in the present fundamentally works against the logical construction of the world: a logical mistake. Again, but for different reasons, logic itself and its laws cannot justify the conclusion, for a social element persists. One must speak to the intuitions of the Other, where logic may speak worlds but never values. It may be true at all possible worlds, but these worlds may be fictions; thus, truth at a fictional world may draw out a question of relevance at this world. Truth at all fictional worlds save the actual, I believe, incurs the same consequence. We may wish to understand the tone or the mode of the statement; <em>must </em>in what sense? By necessity in the same way that a circle must never possess angles at its perimeter? Or such that a square's walls must be equidistant from its center? Moreover, to understand, generally, does not entail that any particular action must be obeyed. What may compel one justifiably to commit suicide, then, is the question. Is a justified suicide self-contradictory?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Well, we had to start from somewhere" was the claim. "Monarchs, we may be, but from bloodshed toward Babylon were we engineered." The man standing before you, clean cut from the dusty bowels of a peculiar industry, could not help himself from rambling restlessly on the linguistic constructions of the age. Charismatic but depleted of substance, he wielded whimsically the intuitions of his comrades, friends and antagonizers; or so it was thought. "It" -- but who may have thought it; and it, so some may have fought it. "No one thinks on these matters, like before, as one once was demanded"; before when? "We date ourselves to the time before the languid tremors emerged into precipitates to decadence" -- still vacuity.

Questions of the sort which demand a datum as their answer imbibe of the boredom and triviality current in our age. The mystic, the mandolin and the marauder mend the sweltering sick stink of their noisome institutions, which demand only allegiance of spirit. "And so the monarchs play their violins, with urgency, celerity and clamor."

Pedestrians of language demonstrate sharp contrast with the peripatetics, the pedants, unprompted by the platitudes which shockingly persuade. Gestures, postures and positions unfold into agreement and concordance of the facts with the great words of a generation. One's hand is held by the climate of the most mundane intellect, even as those who could not liberate themselves to our stature, as those who cannot be, as those slumber in the havens of their world's mind.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Euthyphro</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Source (Euthy): </strong>Is the pious loved by the gods because it is what it is; that is, pious -- or is the pious as such because it is loved by the gods?
<strong>Form:</strong> Is X Y'd by Z because X <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">has X-ness (X-ality, X-iscience, etc)</span> <strong>is X </strong>(the former error actually is the conclusion which is typically drawn, where "having X-ness" amounts to "having a certain quality of being worship'd by the gods"; we do not aim to understand whether X is X-like, for that would leave us still to determine what X is, and X-like could reasonably be defined as "well, here is something that <strong>might </strong>constitute X" -- but we would still be unsure as to whether X is indeed a proper candidate for X-ishness, etc); or  is X X-y (X-ish, X-iful, etc) because X is Y'd by Z?

<dl> <dt>X</dt> <dd>The pious, piety (the Object)</dd> <dt>Y</dt> <dd>Love (Intention, Intentionality, Attitude)</dd> <dt>Z</dt> <dd>The gods (the Authority)</dd> </dl>Either the gods stand outside of that which is pious, and are thus influenced by it, or in virtue of the gods' attitude toward piety, that which is pious -- piety -- sustains or bears piety thus.
<h3>Active and Passive</h3>
I typically call the first horn <em>realism</em>, others decide differently. Piety, right, wrong, etc are entities which, presumably, sustain or bear certain properties independent of influence from Authorities, divine or mundane. The latter horn advances divine command thinking, where the Authority plays an Active role in the properties held by the Object; the former, a Passive role. But along with "command" some additional conceptual consequences follow. Necessarily? I don't know. So let's just say there's a "divine connection," more generally: a conceptual connection, <em>a theological metaphysic</em>.
<h3>Horns</h3>
For the first horn, we might say that the Authority views piety as a source of inspiration or as a muse; the Authority describes or records the behavior of the pious, but the Authority has no authorship over its domain, influence, trajectories, "goals," if you will. Piety, say, is a thing-in-itself, subject not even to the Authority's thrust and telos. The Authority is, in the strictest sense, Passive.

For the second, the Authority engineers, creates, molds and introduces piety. The Authority's attitude and focus'd effort circumscribes piety, control and shape it, found and contain it. The Authority constructs and defines the Object, and is thus, in the strictest sense, Active.
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
In large part, philosophers are concerned with possibilities. A philosopher's chief task can be described as ensuring possibilities for others, other thinkers, objects and their existence, the possibility of description, the possibility of successful reference sentences, unicorns, squar'd-circles, contradiction as possible objects of thought, etc. So, Kant was concern'd with the possibility of the categorical imperative (a fancy moral jewel); Wittgenstein the possibility of a private language; Hume the possibility of a rational inference into future states of affairs (beyond habit and continual perceived conjunction of events); Russell the possibility of marrying the number 3, etc. And Socrates: the possibility of explaining the true nature of things. In my reading, I sense an underlying assumption on Socrates'/Plato's part that if we fail to define or agree on a definition for a thing, it may as well not exist. Naturally language gets hog-tied and ransack'd in the whole intrepid undertaking. So, in a sense, Socrates is on the hunt for the existence of piety. Once defined, existence is granted; but for a thing to exist, the implicit verdict cries, we must come to a complete understanding of it. One feature of understanding, presumably, is the knowing of whether a thing essentially (necessarily) or contingently possesses a certain property or all of its properties. Moreover, granted that the gods are eternal and necessary themselves (?!), their Attitudes, if uninanimous, must also carry with it a kind of necessity. And surely the Object must be eternally sustain'd as such if the gods are unwavering (and they are -- they're "necessary"!). Thus, the problem of Euthyphro unfolds thus:

A: X is surely X.
B: But why?
A: Since [X is X], it is loved for being X.
B: But why is [X is X] true?
A: Maybe the loving of X makes [X is X] true.

Whups! The idea here is that we must expose the Object's definition, not merely describe some feature of it. As it stands, we are none the wiser or more informed as to what X (or piety, or what's right, or what we ought to do, etc). The concept at play, if it is at play, given the discussion, is essentially murky territory, which isn't to say that it cannot be penetrated. And what's at stake here is our uninformed use of the concept. In a way, this problem is similar to Hume's is-ought, except the "is" has been erased: <em>-ought</em>, or vacuous/unprincipled imperatives. Moreover, it takes a metaphysical assumption about the Authority -- that it is necessarily existing or necessarily holds these beliefs as opposed to others -- to counter the claim that the Authority does not only contingently have the Attitude it does have toward the Object.
<h3>Ramble</h3>
If we expose the conceptual machinery, as I've done above, and if we  factor in the concepts of Activity and Passivity, and then finally color  in all the cultural, historical, and metaphysical baggage (along with  all those personal predispositions and preconceptions) usually  associated with the concepts, we get a whole slew of derivative  problems. Generally, as is typical with Socrates, the problem is that [X  is (surely) an X]. But why? Well, now that we've agreed that [X is an  X] and could not be otherwise, we would love to understand why [X is an  X]. That "could not be otherwise" puts us a few steps ahead of  ourselves, but perhaps we should just go there.
<h3>Tangents</h3>
I expose the Form of the argument to underscore its import. Often we see, in expositions of the Problem, substitutions of "piety" with "right" or "moral standards." With the latter, it's clear that the Problem can be made more abstract, covering a greater conceptual landscape; that is, piety typically falls under the domain of "the moral standards" under most ontologies of morality. That said, we could, and often do, use the Form to introduce analogous arguments in every discourse, so long as we pay attention to the conceptual framework doing the work in the Euthyphro argument: The Object, The Attitude, The Authority. And why do they stand in relations of the Active and the Passive? Why do they stand in any relation at all? Why must we assume that Attitudes take on these Active and Passive roles? And why does anything whatever follow from the status of these roles? Is there any bearing on the human condition? Are human lives influenced in any way by the relationships so agreed upon or established? I ask these questions because they apply, assuming adequately re-contextualization, to any derivative problem which may be introduced in near or remote areas of discourse: Anthropology, Science (of Perception), Politics, Art, etc.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>So is this it: I must recognize certain authorities in order to make judgments at all? (OC, 493)</blockquote>
If we bear Kant in mind (provide quotation/s for textual support), we can readily expose W's position through contrast and contextualization. This may be relevant for ethics, primarily, and any other field of philosophical discourse on which practical rationality comes before critical view.

Kant placed his emphasis on the concept of human judgment; and for our purposes: the aesthetic and the teleological.

First, the aesthetic: of the disinterest'd, of (judgment) universality and of necessity -- on objects purposive which may lack practical utility.

By disinterest'd Kant recognizes judgments which lack any grounding in human desire or pleasure. Aesthetic judgments, of this sort, so it is assumed, are possible; chiefly that, in attaching a predicate to a thing, we may do so through inclination untouched by our subjective preferences. We attach it, in a sense, because we determine that the object must have it, regardless of whether it "really" does. The object strikes us as inherently, perhaps, possesses the property. We derive pleasure, then, because of the object as such and our judgment of it; the object imposes upon us, as opposed to our faculty of pleasure compelling us to attach this or that predicate.

We may look at the matter of this kind of judgment in this way: an utterance may be non-propositional; as such, it may also qualify as a valid grammatic form: "the carpet is beautiful." But, we acknowledge that utterances may be causally influenced by sensations, thus becoming <em>replacements </em>for non-linguistic behavior. With this in mind, Kant anticipates the idea of emotivist theories of ethics, at least its conceptual underpinning anyway. The logical grammar, as it were, of such utterances indicates that it is not propositional: Kant aims to concern himself only with judgments which can be candidates for being a proposition. Pain behavior mask'd as linguistic behavior is not relevant.

The other two features of judgment concern, and I'll put this in clunky terms first, our "mental state" whilst engaging in the act of judging. This is partly a psychological assumption, namely that in making judgments we tacitly assume that <em>all others are in agreement </em>and that the object so judged <em>could not fail to possess the property</em> so predicated of it.

Not "all others <em>would be </em>in agreement" -- in a sense, cultural or ethical relativism is implicitly rejected here, for Kant's notion of aesthetic judgment involves the claim that <em>we </em>assume others come from nonexceptional, similar cultural and historical backgrounds. The object is a "real" in our life, and so we assume so for others. (Cultural ignorance goes unexplained when we more to aesthetic judgments of "reserved" or idiosyncratic cultural artifacts.) More or less, Kant identifies a possible kind of realism we all at some level assume in taking judgment.

Added to this is that the object so judged, we assume, that the object came about from purpose, or was undertook through purposive action (or design), though the object itself may not contribute causally or purposely beyond itself. It may not move the world in any way other than that when one views it, one is moved; not necessarily to join this or that political party or what have you, but simply that one is pleased (or derives pleasure from it). The artifact or object itself, so far as its purposive becoming goes, is not connected, or cannot be held accountable for, those events which come about from its being viewed. What has the artist's brush strokes to do with the enraging of a community. The brush strokes had behind them the purpose of completing the piece itself, not the propelling of a nation or, more specifically, the observer. There is a fundamental disconnect between kinds of purpose: there is the purpose behind the, say, physical properties of the piece and the purpose behind the greater, or outer, intentional or nonintentional effects to which said piece may be a determinate cause.

Now, when W makes his claim, I address it in terms of the definition of aesthetic judgment (and later teleological) so defined. Again, to wit:
<blockquote>So is this it: I must recognize certain authorities in order to make judgments at all? (OC, 493)</blockquote>
We have "recognize," "authorities," "in order to," "judgments," and "at all." Like Moore, W had an idiosyncratic way of being succinct, in some cases obscuring his point. With W, have a kind of eloquence and grave way of speak; with Moore, we have a strictly refutational tone which demonstrates the mark of the Everyperson:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Your assumption, truly, is that I am not <em>speaking correctly</em>, -- that my facon de parler suffers from an impropriety which blocks my practical goal -- but what need have I got with your unrestricted concept to which 'unrestricted goal' applies? I need not speak in the way of 'ultimate ends' to talk fruitfully talk about my practical, finite end. Universals, ultimate ends, etc. do not set a criteria for the conclusion of practical ends."</p>
(Revise.)

I make such a point because, at first glance, one should require a clarification:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"'At all'? Such a judgment would be impossible lest I personally count as an authority, but this would abuse the term, as in my private musings there exists no authority unless all others are just as familiar with my personal thoughts as I am. To affirm the positive to the question would mean that all judgments must in principle be public. Such judgments would, in principle, require 'recognizability,' the implicit rejection of judgments in isolation. But then how are 'new judgments' introduced, if "at all" is the qualification? What have <em>I</em> got <em>before</em> the judgment is <em>introduced? </em></p>
<em>And who </em>counts as a valid authority? Or <em>what? </em>What <em>is </em>an authority in such a case?

One feature of a judgment, or a connotation that we commonly, in philosophy, speak of is the involvement of subjectivity. Where a judgment is contrast'd with a report. "The Labour Party has got a sham-system" as opposed to "The Communists took to the streets." The former introduces an opinion in excess of the facts (the Labour Party has some kind of system, of whatever sort, that is complex in some way or other, which brings about consequences in the greater political sphere, consequences on which the judgment expresses its speaker's personal position." The latter reports nothing more than the fact itself and the way in which its speaker chose to express that fact, her own brand of report-language. With all the "realism" at play in Kant, we are left with the question: It seems that Kant attempts to impose a requirement that judgments, in truth, are report-like; judgments not fitting into the "report-framework" fail to be true judgments. But how does this ride with subjectivity? Emotivism?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What CSS Frameworks Must Do</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A CSS Framework must be a codification of definitions of Information Architecture, so far as it influences design (content, functional or otherwise, ontology), Creative (design ontology), a cross-browser grid system; it must it must not needlessly impinge upon server-side controls and must rather assist server-side controls with layout and design (.last-child, .last, .even/.odd classes); it must promote and enable the Standardization and Ease-of-Implementation of all visual elements, common or particular.

I have been developing a Master CSS Framework (<a href="http://nerdfiles.net/gdgs/">GDGS</a>) which, essentially, is not itself a stylesheet, per say. Rather, it is a conceptual tool which outlines the grammar of "master stylesheets" for any particular project, webapp or otherwise. I personally do not believe that being "light-weight" should be a requirement; assuming caching and compression. The ROI for a Framework of the sort on which I have been focusing my efforts, even if 50KB, outweighs such "performances sensitive" arguments. File size alone should not be a determinate of a stylesheet, but rather development capabilities within certain time-frames should also be considered. Moreover, Standardization, Consistency, Communication, and Ease-of-Implementation are the partly defining features of such a Framework.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The internal property of a rule: determine the internal structure of its expression. Take a simple rule: "one, <em>o</em>, must not <em>x</em>"; <em>o</em> here stands in a certain relation, <em>r</em>, to <em>x</em>. In this case, in order for the rule to be said to count as a rule, its internal property must be manifest. Or rather, in the expression we capable to identify the internal property of the rule; it exists in virtue of the property analogous to the relation, <em>r</em>. Thus, rules have internal properties; but what connexion does the internal property have with respect for the rule? We have the mere words, a sentence, utterance, etc., which express the rule, but how is it that this expression's internal logico-grammatical structure occasions to expose the internal property of the rule it expresses? I aim here only to identify that rules have internal properties; in a way, a grammatical structure maps to an internal property of a rule. This property may be isomorphic with the grammatical structure; that is, if the grammatical structure can fail to exist, for a given set of reasons, the property may fail in a similar way to exist.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Raj offers the argument:

1. Mathematics is the language of nature.
2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers.
3. If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge.
Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.

My response:

On this premise (1) I am compelled to focus on the term "nature." In virtue of ZF, we can rule out any such conception of "Nature", "Substance", etc. And I feel, in order for such a premise to be provocative/compelling at all, one must assume that the sense given to the term "nature" bears some socio-intellectual gravity which is aimed at triggering one's contingent imagination; or, more specifically, it must have a sense which makes it a prime target for such a readily available interpretation. (Moreover, do we really wish to assume some kind of innocuous naturalism? Perhaps: but nevertheless, the point I make here concerns the metaphysical pretension I suspect colors this premise.)

So, perhaps my previous statement needs clarification: In ZF -- or rather, assuming ZF, as I feel you are positively personally, intellectually, oriented in this framework -- Russell's Paradox is avoided, but fundamentally it undergirds and constrains ZF; and the axiom of foundation secures the nonexistence of Nature (the provocative sense I take you to mean it; that is, "Substance," as this entire discussion is framed, perhaps even curtailed, by an underlying assumption of monism), "God," the Universe, the One, the Absolute, or even, I s'pose, the object of a grand unified theory/theory of everything.

A "Nature" of the sort assumed, would count as a master set, containing all others, but at the same time would flout Russell's constraint and that of AOF, for it would belong to itself; so, self-containment is ruled out. Now what does it mean for nature not to contain itself? (To contain itself?) Nature is contained by another or that it is simply not contained. With the former, we have infinite regression or dualism here (dualism flies in the face of the pragmatic constraints of mathematics); not contained, we face a problem of monism. If the One is all there is, there must be containment of itself and all things; but this again goes against AOF, etc.

Perhaps this comes down to "containment" and the limitations of the set theoretical metaphor. (What does "Nature" contain?) But that said, on pain of contradiction, we may give up our monism (belief in the One), but how elegant is that? Maybe we're on the wrong foot?

Best is it, I believe, to give up the "nature" business unless we diverge radically from an essentially naturalistic framing of the concept; let's keep the letters but not the force.

The gist of my point is chiefly that "nature" brings unnecessary pain to the argument; however, what's more, I would disagree that there is a more (ontologically?) apt term. Essentially, there is no "Nature" for which mathematics describes; by ZF we can rule out any such thing.

All this said, and for my own bit, I believe that mathematics cannot describe nature, that nature cannot have a language. Nature, as previously understood, is strictly nonexistent. This isn't to say that applied mathematics is a tragic failure; a dose of pragmatism has earned its due. Certainly local regions in the universe can be graphed, represented, modeled, etc; but any such grander implication such that patterns are in nature leaves me with an anxiety: that the conceptual scheme of patterns may illicitly flow into the  domains of art or science; that the form (not conception) of Truth in mathematics may disrupt the form of Truth in science, say.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>._utilityClass { }</h2>
A concept I founded a few months ago and have quickly come to disdain. If one has reached the limit of one's imagination in determining all elements of the Web project (generated a list of all necessary subsequent class names and ID names), one may introduce a utility class for a specific purpose; a flawed intuition behind the utility class is that it is "universal" or would be better served taking residence in some library. These are benefits, perhaps, in themselves, or taken in isolation: universal applicability, a loose implementation, etc., but utility classes also become unwieldy due to the ease with which they can be added. Within any Web project, they are ad hoc; without a Web project, they are Platonic. They are better conceived as attempts to standardize a project, steps in the mental process of formulating a mental "shape" or "form" of the Web project, its scope, etc. To wit, why would one create a set of "._basementN" classes with no need to quickly and without greater influence of the other all implementation, change some set of elements' margin-bottom? In one way, such a class type is conducive to widespread standardize and "re-skinning," assuming the classes have been applied consistently: but this is another downside. Utility classes, in short, are nothing more than potential implementation classes; their existence within any Web project should be considered a shortcoming. Conceptual predecessors of this class amply crop of, the infamous: ".paddingLeft20", "marginRight10", etc. The crucial distinction, however, which still happens to overshoot the fatal flaw of all classes of this type, is that the utility class also attempts to <strong>standard</strong>:  One should never create a "paddingLeft20" which maps to the padding-left CSS property, exposing CSS properties to the implementation (in one way, the markup) reduces coherence; but exposing a standard to an implementation promotes the conceptual role the presentation layer plays within that implementation.
<h2>.structuralClass { }</h2>
Includes "container," "sidebar," "module" (though module is arguably a "semantically loaded" term, "sidebar" as well); may well be identical with "grid system class." The architecture metaphor, and consequent nomenclature, partly determines the applicability and naming of such classes; it is preferred to have these classes' names not intersect with the implementation class conceptual metaphor (the basis or inspiration for naming for implementation classes). Structural classes, in theory, count as the skeleton of the Web project, where the implementation classes constitute is "skin."
<h2>.implementationClass { }</h2>
This class includes complex style definitions which style for:
<ul>
	<li>Buttons</li>
	<li>Rounded Corners</li>
	<li>Drop Shadows</li>
</ul>
The type of the items which fall under the above list vary in terms of complexity. A rounded corners class might be "loose" in that the intention behind the class is to use it in various regions or parts of the Web project, but its (essential) scope is partly defined by the scope of the Web project. They are part of the implementation of the overall application. In a way, one is committed to coupling them to the implementation markup if one uses them at all, and the strength of that coupling is determined by the liberality with which one tacks on this class to new, sui generis elements. "Tight" classes are contrasted primarily with their "looser" counterparts in that the intention behind them is to become coupled with some complex markup structure, but this is taken for granted as a necessary pain. Buttons, for instance, will only have one (or two) markup structures, with varying text node contents. An implementation class for this design element would be just as essential to the Web project as the markup itself. With "tight" implementation classes, the inner markup contents ("btn btnSubmit", "block blockStatusMsg blockStatusError", etc.) remain strictly fixed, saving for text node contents; by contrast "looser" anything below the class may change, e.g., "module modulePrimarySidebar moduleHTMLBox", etc.
<ul>
	<li>Loose Implementation Class: Scope of Applicability partly defined by Scope of the Web project (the total set of pages which constitute the application); e.g. may be applied to generic containers (&lt;div&gt;s), unordered lists, input fields under one project.</li>
	<li>Tight Implementation Class: Scope is stipulated by HTML structures, complex or otherwise, which strictly adopt the class. Indeed, nothing prevents one from applying the class to variants of some "tight" complex markup structure, but this naturally increases code redundancy. So, thought possible, even permitted, such practice is discouraged.</li>
</ul>
<h2>#uniqueCommonPageElement { }</h2>
Includes "Chat Boxes" which follow a user across pages, widgets which are sui generis to all pages (if widgets are dynamically generated: uniqueCommonPageElement1, uniqueCommonPageElement2, ..., uniqueCommonPageElement37, etc.), etc.
<h2>#uniquePageElement { }</h2>
Includes "Status Update" message blocks, navigational elements, content sections, sidebars, and, for the most part, the named structures of a Web project.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[S'pose, at the event of death, you are given the opportunity either to re-live your life again, as it was lived, by you, the <em>first</em> time, or to simply cease to be: an end, death, etc.

At any moment in the construction of a thought experiment, nothing in the words which constitute the expression of that experiment compel one to treat them "literally" or "figuratively," "logically" or "whimsically," etc.

What I concern myself here is with "structured experience." What sense can we give to such an idea? In a way, "structured experience" is a term only meaningful given a sufficiently complex language, containing relational predicates (X is adjacent to Y, (hypothetical) imperatives (the grounding principles under which objects of an experience are <em>expected </em>to behave <em>and </em>how one <em>ought </em>to behave with respect to those objects, entities, etc.), etc.

The topic is of course phenomenological in nature. (Early humanity must have had a concept of structured experience, even if it is incredibly abstract, for the concept itself does not depend on a complexity of language. [Quantitative complexity, not qualitative])

We might say that to step into an automobile is to step into a structured experience. Or rather, an automobile enables a structured experience.

So our initial thought is a presentation, a collection of characters, words, phrases, punctuation, etc. It is underpinned by a set of a logico-grammatical structures, quite like an automobile is structured by mechanical and metal systems, devices, etc. But with a sentence, or set of, and an automobile, each of which <em>can be presented </em>or <em>have presentations, </em>the structure of one is less conspicuous than the other. Of course, the consequences which may follow disrespecting the structure of the automobile results in pain, collision, mild discomfort, etc. With the sentence: nonsense.

I aim only to make this contrast.

But let us take an aside: What does it mean to "repeat" something? One might respond, "Don't play that game! The metaphor is quite clear!" But what must I buy before I checkout?

: Lives can be thought of as sets of experiences, enumerable sets of experiences. In order for this thought experiment to make since, there must be isomorphism. (Often I feel that I am ridiculed for making counterarguments of this form: "There lacks isomorphism in your analogical argument!" I find this odd when I am pitted against someone who fails to recognize the conceptual status of his or her argument, for the Argument from Lack of Isomorphism <em>is </em>a trump of the intuition: "Well obviously it's an analogy, take from it what resonates with you." My claim here, the trump, is that <em>nothing quantifiable could be taken from an argument which fails by the Argument from Lack of Isomorphism.</em>

Is a life a set of enumerable experiences? One consequent of <em>choosing </em>life-on-repeat is, well, life-<em>on-repeat. </em>So, in a answer, if one does answer the question at all, one <em>has answered the question already. </em>But, perhaps there is an asymmetry: Answering affirmatively entails that one has answered it before, and thus that lives are enumerable sets of experiences; but not vice versa (answering negatively).

We have an understanding, roughly of what counts as living a life, what counts as living, what is alive, etc. "Life-on-repeat" however commits one to a weighty ontology, I think. But Quine might think otherwise.

I am concerned here with <em>ontological commitment</em>, lives as enumerable sets of experiences.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Descriptive language as the criterion for a sophisticated form of consciousness. Enables one to build in the abstract.

The quality of descriptive language, which is a subset of any arbitrary language, determines the quality of intention. Without description, observed or otherwise, it makes little sense to speak of intention. Descriptive language grounds any conceptual scheme wherein objects are sutured to intentional frameworks. Without a descriptive "building up," even if riddled with falsity, of such multiplicity, which the world compels upon us, consciousness, C, amounts to an indissoluble, inscrutable mass of intractable qualities.

Hence, we look for the <em>Descriptive</em> in animal languages.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The idea that the neural can replace the psychological is the same idea that led to thinking that all psychological ills can be cured with drugs.
-- <em>Burge</em></blockquote>
Surprise, surprise! Reductionism in neuroscience! But not one mention of Peter Hacker or Max Bennett's work, Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience. Sure, it's only one book, and perhaps it's great that this philosopher has arrived at his woes independently — but perhaps that's another problem: that the author of this article has likely only heard of it in passing, whilst zipping through the corridors of UCLA.
<blockquote>In recent years popular science writing has bombarded us with titillating reports of discoveries of the brain’s psychological prowess.  Such reports invade even introductory patter in biology and psychology.  We are told that the brain — or some area of it sees, decides, reasons, knows, emotes, is altruistic/egotistical, or wants to make love.  For example, a recent article reports a researcher’s “looking at love, quite literally, with the aid of an MRI machine.”  One wonders whether lovemaking is to occur between two brains, or between a brain and a human being.

... First, it provides little insight into psychological phenomena.

... Second, brains-in-love talk conflates levels of explanation.

... The third thing wrong with neurobabble is that it has pernicious feedback effects on science itself.
-- <em>Burge</em></blockquote>
One obvious consequence of "getting the 'mind' wrong" is that in lieu of motivating the introduction of novel concepts to the program of artificial intelligence, neuroscience of this unfortunate conceptual scheme/tradition presents an impoverished, normative model of the brain. Aside from muddling descriptions with confused and unfit metaphors, the corpus of neuroscience itself becomes a storehouse for antiquated empirical [descriptions]; more importantly, future science will have less ingenuity to depend upon, from current science, since current science is concerned with developing nothing more than a static image of not only its object, but of itself. ("This is what we [see] in the 'mind'"; as opposed to: "This is how the mind works. Is your object of investigation [similar] to ours?" -- I am sure this is the underpinning aspect of divisive science (non-collaborative science).) Without question, the brain and computer systems are ontologically different, but that difference need not carry over into the explanatory principles which ground our understanding of human cognitive, conative, perceptual, &amp;c phenomena and categorically distinct artificial systems and sub-systems of AI projects. The bridge of explanations between these two discourses stand a stipulated conceptual asymmetry between their objects of study.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[His name is unimportant, and I won't bore you with introduction. Short of it is, he sent the following message to me.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">RE:  Best Practice SEO:
Body: <a href="http://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">http://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/</a></p>
It should become clear, through my second e-mail response, how my first e-mail response and what you see above are connected. But just in case: Open the link in the Body: and search for "breadcrumb".
<h2>First e-mail response</h2>
W,

As to the first point, it is consistent with the one I made on the call. This has less to do with SEO and more to do with Usability (navigating the site more easily). And Usability is itself its own unique practice in Web development, along with Accessibility.

Since the introduction of XML sitemaps, breadcrumbs have been rendered obsolete. Nothing more easily informs a crawler of your site's "structure" than a well-formed XML document, whose chief reason for being introduced as a technology is its structure and that structure's ability to reduce the interpretation required of a search engine crawler or parser. Granted, before sitemaps, breadcrumbs were a means of enabling the capture of a site's structure by crawlers, but at the same time, breadcrumb trails are isolated to one page. Thus, the crawler, for instance, would need to crawl the entire site, which takes time, more time for larger sites, to formulate a "picture" of the site structure, based on independently existing documents that contain unique breadcrumbs. A sitemap is one file that the crawler need only hit once, and for any subsequent hits, the crawler already knows where the file is (since no one changes the sitemap's location frequently, nor need they change it).

Thus, neither point from Yoast substantiates the claim that breadcrumbs are good for SEO. They were an inefficient means to boost search engine rankings before the whole Web got smarter (smarter crawlers, smarter algorithms, smarter browsers, smarter, more robust technologies).

I would like to make another point, though. It seems that the scope of our project is turning into something quite different. This is known as "scope creep." While I may be able to provide you with brief introductions to topics on Wordpress and comments here and there about "best practice," given the specific requirements and features of your projects, I have not agreed to a full consulting role, nor have I agreed to participating in argument-by-proxy with "trusted sources."

You must understand what is communicated with messages like the one you have sent. It implies very clearly to me a lack of trust in my abilities and knowledge, as you do not indicate what you mean to say specifically, and given the generic nature of the article, one could easily infer that it is believed that I should read it in its entirety.

I understand that I may have overly complicated our scheduled talks earlier today, and I by no means seek sympathy for my other projects impinging upon yours, but these administrative issues are very separate and distinct from what training and knowledge I have both earned and acquired over the span of my career.

I really do not mean to be heavy-handed about this, or rude, but at the same time, it's not exactly clear how you expected me to respond to your message. There was no attempt to spark discussion and it seems somewhat passive aggressive.

If you feel that what I have explained so far is inaccurate or unhelpful, please say this, but "corrective" e-mails with no foundation for discussion will do us more harm than good if we are to continue this project.
<h2>Second e-mail response</h2>
<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Arial} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Arial; min-height: 15.0px} span.s1 {text-decoration: underline ; color: #1c0ad9} -->

W,

Actually, I believe it is better to call this Web project off. I cannot say that I apologize for my apparently quick-tempered response. This project, as you must clearly see, was taken on good faith. M D is a close friend beyond a co-worker/co-developer, and so my reason for taking this project had less to do with financial incentive and more to do with following through on what Matt and I mutually observed to be a low stress, timeline aggressive, high value collaborative effort.

But with your message, you have committed three improprieties at once, which cannot go unnoticed:
<ol>
	<li>Failure to prompt discussion</li>
	<li>Demonstrated lack of trust</li>
	<li>Inability to follow discussion</li>
</ol>
To the first and second points, your message gave me no guidance as to its point, and this resulted in a passive aggressive implied tone which colored what could not be perceived any other way than as a test of my knowledge. I'm not exactly sure I deserved that. Put yourself in my position: As a developer yourself, in your field, you always meet clients eager to best to tech staff of their consultants. This is how you appear just by calling out that you are yourself a developer. So naturally if you send a message like the previous one, I can plausibly assume that you think you yourself know my craft better than I. And this, in fact, is not the main point, for at the same time, you describe yourself as a good communicator, one I assume has mastered the graces of conversational exchange. Your message, combined with the qualities of "good communicator" and "hobbyist web developer," for your part, supply me with compelling evidence to assume that you are in some way attempting to manipulate the terms of our engagement. Why be so blithely tactless if a good communicator? As a developer, this can only mean a lack of trust. You should have obviously seen that I would take it this way. And if you don't trust me, why should I not interpret your message as a sign of you yourself dropping this project. (As yet, you have not responded to my message and have gave no indication that you sent your own message by accident.)

(Also, and this is just an aside which does not pertain to my actual argument, but if you're going to screen share, in the future, make sure you clear out your browsing history or disable thumbnails in Chrome should you have porn sites in your history. Perhaps this has to do with tact. I know for certain that many of my colleagues would terminate all interaction, lucrative or otherwise, should they find themselves, by no will of their own, placed in the unsettling scenario of having to see a complete stranger's personal, private pornographic interests in the middle of a conference call.)

And bear in mind, again, the nature of the entire collaborative effort: You are getting an immensely fair deal; PSDtoWordpress (less than 48 [hours]), Wordpress set up, Wordpress plugins, minor consulting, possible design consulting, for $400-$450. Companies like <a href="http://psd2html.com/">psd2html.com</a>, who provide exactly these services, would charge in the range of $900-$950. (Walk through their "Order" section and fill in each field based on the features you have listed in your e-mail, assuming that I would provide the "hi-end" package with Wordpress options and highest quality coding standards.)

To the third point: You had absolutely no reason to post that message. Everything that was said about breadcrumbs was circumscribed by the requirements of The Daily Cougar project, one unique project. It was not claimed that breadcrumbs are inherently flawed or useless or that they should never be used. It was stated that they were not used, not that they should not be used. And certainly not that they should not be used on [your] project. So it is totally unclear what prompt'd you to send the message, given its content alone. It would seem that your intent was nothing more than to argue like a pedant, as if your message were a word of warning about the decision(s) made on The Daily Cougar project. (And what's more, your pedantry was sourced in outdated information.)

With all that said, it should be clear what I have decided. Any further communication, as I am sure you can assume now, will be a waste of both our time. Your e-mail messages have been consigned to my "trash" and I have blocked your number.

Good day.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On modal windows and &quot;Lazy Interaction Design&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Modal windows have become widely deployed in various Web applications and Web sites, largely motivated by their "wow"-factor. Without the right implementation strategy, a developer could turn Pop-up's hotter sister into an accessibility nightmare, <em>JavaScript disabled.</em>

Without a fall-back option, for users who unwittingly disable JavaScript or who use assistive technologies not smart enough to interpret complex JavaScript, or which disable JavaScript for their users, a modal window design pattern could prevent, albeit small, a portion of the Web from accessing the important stuff, the content. Sure, internal Web apps or projects which assume JavaScript enabled are safe from such concerns, but the Web is a different story.

Accessibility considerations increase the effort necessary to develop any project: it's a plain fact. If one wants modal windows on the Web, one had better develop a fall-back for the world of JavaScript disabled. This imposes a requirement of a flexible modal window library (usually), a need to radically re-consider one's development pattern (for implementing the modal window pattern and making it compatible within the limitations of the rest of the tech stack, client- and server-side).

Now, most Web developers are aware of all of this. These points determine the frame in which front-end developer might participate any discussion on modal windows, especially user experience discussions.

Typically justification for modal windows appeals to the dictum of <em>shiny, new hotness. </em>Much the same way Flash earned its popularity. Inherently there's nothing wrong with this argument: the Web <em>should </em>be prettier, have increased usability, accessibility, etc. But this principle of design usually is placed on the table without mention of the inherent features or technical aspects of a modal window. To say the least, user experience teams should bear in mind that modal windows are <em>modal. </em>What does it mean to be <em>modal?</em>

One argument that bases itself in the concept of modality, sometimes proposed by UX folks, is: <em>Restrict the interaction of the user to promote focus and usability. </em>The modal window simplifies things for the user; it forces a user to attend only to the modal window and its contents.

In a sense, <em>modality implies urgency.</em> I often see modal windows used outside of "emergency" situations or "urgent attention needed" situations (deleting that really important thing that contains all the cool stuff you have downloaded), but merely as a tool for narrowing user focus when navigating forms or submitting data.

Moreover, it is claimed that modal windows promote usability (decreased mental/cognitive load) since the user is limited to a smaller range of actions to make within a Web page environment: the modal window visually and functionally (usually) limits what the user can do. But is a modal window design pattern really necessary assuming a well-done, logical information architecture? In many cases, modal windows are used to make up for less-than-desirable or poorly designed aspects of the basic user interface and IA. Like entering a building by helicopter (landing on the conspicuous pad) because the front-door is cluttered by people (say, because of a popular event that's been unexpectedly hosted inside). In some cases, such a (grandiose) entrance is necessary, but, switching back to our target concept, modal windows, in most cases they are used because the entrance (or the rest of the building; i.e., the Web site), cannot account for peculiar circumstances (say, when business requirements somehow translate into a 25 field Web form on a single page; or fundamentally different types of content sitting on one page; say, a form and a really important info graphic that the user must have access to). Split up the form, or just endure it (what kind of business is it anyway?). I'm sure there's a storehouse of IA literature that deals with simplifying Web forms. Hell, I should probably dive into it myself.

Of course, Web sites and Web projects are nowhere near as complicated as a building's architecture and design. But I think the point holds: Where is the deeper argument behind modal windows? This is what I'm searching for, a justification beyond <em>shiny, new hotness.</em>

More attention to information architecture and usability flow, I think, defeats the narrow'd-interaction/usability argument; and, what's more, as said, modal windows imply a sense of urgency, where I believe in some cases it is unnecessary. Why not just explode the functionality within the modal window onto the page, using some cool localized state management DOM scripting? Less "drilling down" and tangential interaction (going down rabbit holes) by the user; less round-about development and implementation (JavaScript enabled and disabled scenarios); less management necessary between front-end and server-side. And if JavaScript is disabled, pass that server-side to treat form interaction accordingly (hard way) or assume it (as if JavaScript never existed) through ensuring that "warnings" and "prompts," however complex, make it either to the Browser's confirm or some tangential flow that eventually puts them back snugly where they began. (You'd have to build it anyway if you had to build a 508c Web application: the more you localize functionality and compact it onto a page, web designer, the more a developer has to build out from it to conform to Web accessibility standards.)

To say the least, it isn't quite clear to me that restriction of user interaction is itself a good thing for usability or user experience. From a personal stance I often find it jarring to have Netflix or Facebook <em>steal my window. </em>

But I have stumbled onto an interesting opinion. <em>Modal windows should only be used for complex tasks, never for simple tasks. </em>Granted, modals may be jarring and they're sometimes counterintuitive (if done incorrectly). But look at Netflix's "Add" functionality. It is difficult to imagine what the alternative would be: a new page that loads, where you have lost your current, parent page's state. Preserving the parent Web document's state is important, but Yes/No modals, say on "delete" buttons, I feel should be re-casted into some other nifty UI feature: say, persistent functionally-modal tooltips. Tooltips that do not visually close until dealt with and who <em>block </em>the original interaction until dealt with. I'm sure there's a way to make these visually appealing and they don't <em>steal your window. </em>I suppose they would promote what I might call "lazy interaction."

Sure, it's a big deal that you're about to delete your so-and-so account on the whatchamacallit <abbr title="Cleverly Named Initialism">CNI</abbr> system, but one key principle behind front-end development is that<em> false positive interaction should be minimized</em>. We don't want to delete accounts in the system, say, only because of a user's unstable, dance-about shaky click finger and mouse. But such a requirement can be just as well satisfied with "lazy interaction" design. Don't <em>steal </em>or <em>intrude </em>on the user's system, but <em>be more suggestive</em>. Let the UI <em>enable </em>interaction, not <em>en</em><em>force it.</em>

Though, with UI components like the one found in Netflix, I can see a justification for the use of the modal window: there's a lot going on in that thing. It's <em>complex information </em>more so than <em>complex interaction. </em>I'll have to consider this point again in the near future, but for some reason it seems independently compelling that one should use modal windows in cases of <em>complex form interaction </em>or <em>rich information presentation</em> (Netflix). Another good argument is for <em>persistent forms</em> across pages, like Feedback or Contact us, but this are <em>complex forms, </em>not simple "Yes/No" or "choose one!" forms, which is a common use-case for modal windows.

Of course, it makes it even more difficult to see a <em>good total justification</em> for modal windows when the only argument usually is <em>shiny, new hotness </em>[and] <em>given that </em>browsers have innate modal window functionality. For me, in the end, the result is usually a wealth of hacks (for unruly, ancient browsers like IE6) and overly complicated development patterns across multiple languages, technologies and developers, all for either proof <em>that </em>browsers can pull 'em off or <em>that </em>developers are ingenious.

I find it difficult to imagine that the average user spends enough time looking at the modal window to allow it to shift their perception of the brand or trust, etc. And largely the cool factor behind modal windows is bound up with, or follows from, modality, which inherently is neither good nor bad for the user experience, but rather depends on the nature of the thing given that modality.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For a time I held the belief that all agnostics are atheists -- in philosophical denial, &amp;c.; <em>my conclusion here</em>, however, more than less, will be that agnostics are <em>conceptually confused </em>(as opposed to being <em>irrational </em>or <em>rationally unjustified</em>), for those feeling TL;DNR -- on the assumption that the suspension of belief implies a lack of belief; therefore, all agnostics are atheists. Really, who could deny that a <em>withheld</em> belief is <em>missing</em> belief? How many other synonyms, anecdotes or analogies could I throw at such an odd, presumably rational rebuttal? It seems almost a meta-philosophical position, inherently so, that agnosticism! Contained is a positive belief (something <em>epistemological</em>, roughly amounting to some position about the state of Knowledge, &amp;c. -- Would an agnostic entertain a discussion which presupposes philosophical merit to the term <em>religious knowledge?</em>) which fails to intersect with the conceptual trajectory of the question raised: <em>Do you believe in X</em>?<em> </em>-- <em>Well, I don't know if X exists. </em>I've felt this oddness so often: <em>knowledge presupposes belief</em>. So, as far as <em>conversational*</em> exchanges go, such an <em>epistemological</em> response begs the question, so to speak (*crude analogy, admitted).

One is not being asked what one <em>knows </em>or <em>speculates to knows </em>but <em>what one believes.</em> My estimation now, from what of those memories I can gather, is that my early meta-philosophical intuition was something closely related to the subtle, festering unease &amp; anxiety one feels when it is sharply realized that one's conversation partner has gone <em>off-topic </em>-- that is to say, that agnosticism is <em>philosophically off-topic.</em>

So my "refutation" to agnosticism was at once both a fashionable philosophical subversion, OLP-style, within "skeptical" social circles and arrangements, and a nasty (usually impromptu) prompt: <em>You're in denial! Now defend your atheism, heretic!</em>

And why should anyone <em>defend their atheism? </em>Is it not merely the lack of belief? Well, agnostics lack belief too! (Maybe!) But children, your dog or your neighbors dog, or your dog's neighbor's pup, grains of sand between your toes, field roast sausage, bananas, asteroids, gods (What utility do <em>beliefs </em>bring to gods? <em>Imagine that!</em>), all the tornadoes last Sunday, books, the Universe, atoms, languages, ideologies, sets, Numbers, political parties (except in an odd, <em>figurative-philosophical sense </em>but one could argue -- and I just might! -- an <em>idiomatic sense</em>), &amp;c. also lack belief in gods, or whatever <em>interesting god</em> of the season.

Then I learn'd of the varieties of atheism: weak, strong, strict, philosophical, practical, pragmatic, scientific, &amp;c. And then there's "non-theism" and "non-belief"; it's a real buffet, indeed. What the varieties indicate, in truth, is that atheism consists of at least two conceptual components: a positive claim and, as discussed above, a negative orientation.

The claim, such that God[does not exist, cannot exist, should not exist]; <em>Gne</em>, shall we? I'll explain anyhow. On the first, I would say it is primarily the basic proposition for <em>verificationist </em>language games<em>. </em>The proposition functions as a basic representation of <em>observation-fallibility models</em> <em>of justification </em>(logical positivism, falsifiability, scientism, pragmatism, instrumentalism, functionalism, &amp;c). The second represents the <em>logical</em> <em>model of justification </em>(noncognitivism, emotivism, most philosophical positions, nihilism, &amp;c)<em>. </em>The third the <em>moral, or ethical, </em>model of justification (problem of evil, existentialism, &amp;c). As said, this claim, constituted by <em>at least three </em>(I'm sure you can think up other categories) models of justification, amounts to the positive aspect of atheism. It distinguishes atheism from non-belief, though atheism presupposes it, and in similar fashion, the positive aspect of atheism distinguishes it from agnosticism since agnosticism is, if <em>on-topic, </em>at most a non-belief toward G, <em>off-topic, </em>a positive position as to the (metaphysical?) situation of human knowledge (epistemology).

So, then, it should become clear, the crassness of my "prompt": if agnostics are preoccupied, philosophically (which can arrest one spiritually, mentally, intecllectual for months, years, &amp;c), with, unwittingly or not, the "metaphysical situation of human knowledge (epistemology)," being off-topic, since it is a broader discussion and does not itself presuppose the significance of "religious knowledge," it must be a show of poor philosophical table manners to accuse and assert all at once: <em>Atheist!</em>, for one likely has failed to see the tangled alignment of philosophical concepts, and thus has failed to even imagine a response to the question; thinking, perhaps, it bogus or somehow inappropriate (the question, and sorry for the lack of due repetition, being <em>Do you believe in ...?</em>) The agnostic simply doesn't have a response because there is, in a way, and for good humor, a <em>psycho-theological block. </em>I could fancy the idea that since agnostics are intellectual champions, given the logical relationship knowledge and belief have, such that knowledge presupposes belief (or is "higher" or "more complex" or "tougher" or "stronger" or whatever), they need not bother themselves with the unstable domain of belief, where everything's more or less up for grabs anyway. One can believe whatever one wishes whilst agnostics leer in the clouds, plotting, scheming, dealing with the <em>real problems </em>or the <em>deep problems</em>, all the while, and to push this disingenuous hunch further, the problems of belief are ignored.

My project here is becoming difficult to maintain. A re-thinking of the categories in which we frame these aspects of atheism may be in order. Instead of "positive" and "negative," I should use "transitive consciousness" and "intransitive consciousness" which, I believe, color the concept of atheism. We might say there is an <em>atheist of </em>and an <em>atheist because. </em>Most atheists are not conscious of the <em>negative state </em>they are in; and, of course, this state does not imply a philosophical position or any awareness that one <em>is </em>an atheist. A parrot could only parrot a proof for the existence of god, a genuine non-believer; but an atheist isn't just a non-believer. Atheism <em>says </em>something, beyond the "intransitive" business. Agnostics are "intransitive atheists"; this is uninteresting, but what is interesting is this claim, which I hope can emerge from all of this: To count as an atheist, one must claim <em>Gne </em>and <em>one must provide a justification (which is itself bound to a "model" of justification) for Gne.</em>

So, to count as an atheist?
<ul>
	<li>One <em>must, </em>ceteris paribus, sincerely believe <em>Gne</em>,</li>
	<li>One <em>must </em>have a justification for Gne (which presupposes a satisfaction of the <em>transitivity requirement </em>and the justification's model may or may not fit into the three I have specified; there are more, surely!)</li>
	<li>One <em>may</em> satisfy the <em>intransitivity requirement </em>(though, this is just the state of non-belief; in a very strict sense, with this terminology, the agnostic <em>misses </em>the <em>object of denial</em>, the epistemic preoccupation <em>overlooks </em>or perhaps <em>blocks </em>the introduction of the object; i.e., G, so, like an infant or a mountain, the agnostic is effectively in a <em>state </em>of atheism but one which is not conscious, transitive, etc.)</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For basic hyperlinks, or anchors, there's no question as to what  the <code>HTML content</code> (the HTTP payload) should be; i.e., what one sees when one calls <code>View Source</code> or <code>View Page Source</code>:
<pre>&lt;a</pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;"> href="http://domain.com/some/human-readable/url/"
title="Relevant copy that gives a title to the link"&gt;</pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px;">TextNode</pre>
<pre>&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
But with the wild west that was "practical JavaScript" of the mid- to late-90s, anchors took on a various additional, sometimes counterintuitive roles, through the practices of clever Web developers aiming to build in dynamic behaviors into the Web browser. The anchor took on the role of being the <em>sole </em>event-hook -- from dry and boring <code>html/text</code> through the eyes of theDOM -- into JavaScript programs. Such practices were largely motivated by Trident browsers' limited implementation of the "onclick" or "click" event. Back in the day, one could not just attach onClick to a &lt;div&gt; or really anything else for Trident browsers: one got anchors and so one had to make due.

It seems that even today some Web developers still rap about questions like: 'Should I use <code>href="javascript:void(0)</code>" or <code>href="#"</code>?' Of course, with libraries like jQuery and Prototype, such questions become immediately invalid. One finds in these libraries cross-browser sensible binders that allow one to preserve the Separation of Concerns. That is, don't put nasty JavaScript in the HTML source. The HTML source is the article for the crawler or assistive technology, and their parsing algorithms are going to attempt to overlook or get around aberrant forms of markup. But it still slows them down when they have to enter those sub-routines, and such circumnavigation of oddities in HTML schemas costs cycles, ultimately, for the overall task that the device is to perform. Even if these bots have sufficiently evolved to provincially comprehend JavaScript, and present it in a structured, predictable manner, this obstacle for bot-developers raises the question for Web developers of the best practice which prevents undermining those bots from accomplishing their task. Libraries like jQuery solve this problem, sure, but the question remains: Why do these practices persist?

Moreover, it seems that each deviant form triggers inconsistent behavior across multiple browser platforms. Or, let's say, some forms are often seen as programmatically similar, in developers' unit tests, but, when actually, behind the scenes, they may perform quite differently between any two given browsers. For instance, in Chrome 10.x and Firefox 3.6.x, <code>@href="#"</code> and <code>@href="javascript:;"</code> both cancel the default behavior of an anchor, yet when binding animations, the latter "out performs" the former, or rather, ensures better performance. Why should this be the case for those browsers but quite different for Trident-based rendering engines? Does the latter form route the anchor's communication with the DOM differently? "<code>#</code>" hooks to <code>@id</code>s on the page, as an document-internal referencing procedure. Think <em>pointing to your head </em>when someone asks you for your <em>thoughts</em>, as opposed to <em>pointing to an essay </em>when someone asks you for your <em>thoughts on the current nuclear crisis of country X. </em>By the W3C understanding of "<code>@href</code>", it's fair. Is linking to a JavaScript file fair? In some cases, where one intends to offer a download. But what about an abstraction in JavaScript? Does <code>sendToSiteStatistics()</code> (a JavaScript function) make sense does under the scope of <code>@href</code>? Is this a purist's dilemma? Why would one refer to parts of a Web application? What does the user care?

But the problem is more nuanced than this. One often finds, after Viewing Source:

&lt;a
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">href="#"
title="Relevant copy that gives a title to the link"
class="sendToSiteStatistics openCrayonBox"&gt;</pre>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">Open my Crayon Box</pre>
<pre>&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
Say that after the user clicks the anchor, a modal window appears (<code>openCrayonBox</code>) which contains a slew of design tools <em>and</em>, implicitly, data is sent to the site stats application using its sophisticated API. If JavaScript is disabled? No sweat, it's a crayon box. Why would a crawler care about that? That is, it's a web application, or part of. It's meant to be used, not interpreted or "read". Fair enough.

But what if the modal window contain'd simply an image? That's no different from an image on the page which contains the link; in fact, the link and the image may, in terms of View Source, be "sibling tags" (but we should really say "elements", since the notion of sibling is meaningful at a semantic-level (in the DOM) and only superficial at a syntactic level (the characters themselves can't know or care who they sit next to; all the same, the tags can't know or care; the parser-interpreter uses these arrangements of characters to build a picture for the browser, as efficiently as it can.

So why not link to the image? Or perhaps a page that contains it? That bot or clever crawlers needs to hit something, and it certainly isn't going to try too hard to follow-through on what <code>arbitraryFunctionFoundOnTheWeb()</code> thinks the content of the <code>@href</code> should be. There's no connection between them, in principle, or implementation, rather, but one can be made in practice; and one often is. With functions in JavaScript, one can manipulate the DOM; however, the crawler needs to first find out, before all else, where that function is actually stored physically or in memory. Say, the parser stumbles onto the function syntax, then inspects all JS documents or <code>&lt;scripts&gt;</code> embedded into the HTML document. It has already consumed these chunks of code anyway; what else is it going to do with them? True; but who's job is it do pull off this parsing miracle? The crawler? The browser? The developer? Coordination is in order.

But in truth, the term "<code>arbitrary</code>" is operative chiefly because in this context, it is meaningful. At least this is an assumption that the crawler must make; and a presentation change does not always follow from function calls. Why should the bot assume that it must re-inspect the document because a particular function simply fired? Functions do more than just bootstrap CSS (which is someone one shouldn't practice too regularly anyway; remember the Separation of Concerns).

A DOM implementation is a <em>subset </em>of JavaScript, which is itself a subset of EcmaScript. The problem might be that <em>any valid JavaScript syntax </em>may be placed in <code>@href</code>. Is it the crawler developer's job to develop a generic solution that isolates the DOM from the superset that is all of JavaScript? Perhaps.

What of those bits of JavaScript syntax that might disrupt the crawler insofar as its respect for the standardized <code>@href</code>? In truth, JavaScript could tell the crawler to <em>stop</em>, in a syntactically valid way (e.g., <code>javascript:void(0)</code>). That is, instead of saying<em> something </em>JavaScript can be used to force anchors to say <em>nothing </em>to the browser itself. Bots and crawlers must then keep this in mind when parsing JavaScript, should they bother to venture that fair. The gist of this issue is that many assumptions go into connecting the layers of the Separation of Concerns (SoC), and if crawlers want to "experience" the end result that those assumptions produce, crawler developers so too must enter the complex world of Web development.

And yet, these developers wish to develop assistive technologies and data miners, not sophisticated browsers. Moreover, there are obviously better ways (jQuery with the right naming conventions for <code>@class</code>) to facilitate the connection between SoC layers.

The question left: How should we respond to these practices? Do we toss the baby out with the bath water? Is there some actual generic problem -- when one takes a step back to understand the intention, effect and prompt for each approach -- that these tactics set out to solve? (And there are others, I'm sure; especially for canceling anchors and, seemingly, their communication with the DOM in which they are but a node). To me, they strike as now-outmoded by-products of the wild wild web, as it was just maturing from its infancy, and such code should be correct'd wherever discover'd.

		<title>The Problems of UI Development: Part One / &lt;div&gt; and @class-itis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[JavaScript has received a bad rap since its introduction, and its notorious reputation certainly has come to precede its actual rank, expressiveness and elegance, etc., as a language. Moreover, in principle, the language itself is interpret'd; thus, its perception is inherently framed by those implementations -- Web browsers -- which choose to adopt it, with greater or lesser accuracy by those browser developers' hands. Unfortunately, all this spilled into the bucket of the "front-end engineer," since JavaScript is one of the many languages which this role oversees. Ill-reputable language, ill-reputable developer. Certainly a pragmatic assumption.

But I should rather start of with a more modest topic, one which likely falls under the former, more grandiose sociological theme. Others might include Readability; a questions as to how OOP fits in given that most classically-train'd programmers and developers today stand firm either from ignorance, rigid definition, or lack of imagination against the notion that any of the languages govern'd by "the UI" individually possess the expressiveness and architecture to support more sophisticated design patterns (generally OOP in nature); piloting, or pilot integration, within legacy systems; the god of the gaps between daily methodologies between uxers, designers, business teams, and "centralized-compiler" teams; integration within management systems and code-generation systems; the <em>role</em> of the front-end engineer; the conceptual significance of description languages in Web application in light of the separation of concerns; etc.

Today, however, I will entertain a perplexing question that for me remains too complex to state specific terms. At the moment I should wish to remain very distant from the stratospheric topic, or set of, previously mention'd. I am in no position to guard such a posture.

The problem is this. Two principles guide programmers: Be Explicit and Avoid Redundancy. They are so basic and general such that rejecting them individually immediately engenders obstacles for developers. Not being explicit hinders code readability and comprehension; redundancy increases code overhead and, usually, decreases performance. All that said, a practical problem that follows from these principles arises when one determines a naming convention scheme for "meta-HTML" in the context of Websites and Web applications. Developers shun those who submit to &lt;div&gt;- and @class-itis, primarily because of an implied principle that was born from the disdain for bloated &lt;table&gt;-based layouts and templates. Now there is an implicit tenet such that &lt;div&gt;-itis, say, has a common methodological problem with &lt;table&gt;-based development: code bloat. But is it redundant? What exactly is the basis for attacking &lt;div&gt;-itis culprits? @class-itis is a different topic, since it can take on various forms. @class-itis is usually a veiled criticism of poor naming convention adoption and the misuse of @class names. Yet @class-itis often presupposes a kind of complex &lt;div&gt; arrangement, something akin to &lt;div&gt;-itis. A preliminary problem is the criteria for identifying when these suspect methodological patterns objectively arise in Web projects; then one might come closer to understanding the basis for the attack. For it is one discussion to have such facts about a Web app, say, be true, namely that there is a presence of this aberrant design patterns, and another to state why they are problematic for the context in which they occur.

Above all this, assuming that transparency of architecture, or "being explicit," is key, thus ignoring the pains of redundancy, there is a question as to whether any generic, or universal, naming convention schema is palatable for wide adoption. But, on the other hand, considering the pains of redundancy, there is an initial question, I believe, of whether a "universal naming convention schema" for @classes in Web application would be necessary to trump the criticism of redundancy, code bloat, and other similarly incurred troubles.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>User Interface Metaphors</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another set of thoughts to be contributed to <em>The Problems of UI Development</em>.
<h2>How content determines metaphor</h2>
A Web project's content limits the range of applicability in user interface metaphor. Even further, then, since a wider range of user interface metaphor enables a greater potential for development of intuitive and accessible controls within a user interface system, a Web project's content partly determines the range of viable device-accessible development practices, where one practices the development of user interface metaphors that are conscientious of human and non-human consumers, possessing a wide range of psychological and physical abilities and limitations.
<h2>A problem for user interface management</h2>
User interface developers often speak of future-proofing our Web applications, and this concept has certainly influenced the development practices of cowboy coders and freelancers in the wild. Content management systems have broken down the barrier of entry which might prevent a developer from offering nearly self-managing products, Web projects and Web apps, to their clients. With these two concepts, self-management and future-proof, one might consider their application in the practices of user interface development. Beyond allowing a client to manage their content and, to some extend, their brand, a more difficult problem would be to allow them to manage their <em>metaphor. </em>By <em>self-management, </em>I refer to a capacity to allow a client to control and reliably choose a set of user interface metaphors by which that client might express her message, within a Web context. Future-proofing applies in a bit of an indirect way: By allowing one to manage one's own content, the developer in a limited sense <em>future-proofs </em>the project itself. This often translates into a break from "maintenance commitment" which clients often assume the developer implies merely in virtue of providing complex and, often counterintuitive, systems that is the product.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Look, <a title="There Is No Page Fold" href="http://www.thereisnopagefold.com/" target="_blank">There Is No Page Fold</a>.

Web designers and developers should embrace all of the UI functionality and constraints that makes the Web a <em>sui generis</em> medium for communication: the Web browser, the OS, the screen resolution, the monitor size, the device on which a UI is expressed. The Web's form is much different from print's, and this should be acknowledged fully by the UI and the UX designer.

I honestly believe the only real reason this page fold junk conceptually infected web design is due the dependency users have on the mouse. Why else completely disregard a UI element that is integral to <em>web design. </em>Are standard UI components inferior when pitted against the principles of print design? So it's easier to scroll with the mouse since, well, you're already using it. To scroll the page quickly and intuitively, one may use the Page navigation keys, which are standards in most keyboard formats, or the Arrow keys.

I wouldn't stop short of just calling this lazy computer usage, or a lack of disciplined understanding of how to properly operate a keyboard. Most users have no clue what Home and Page Up do, since their behaviors are largely contextual, and what's more, these keys are often hidden across a wide range of popular keyboard models. Even further, again, one's hand, upon entering a site, is usually already on the mouse. I s'pose it's a matter of consistency, or standardization.

In any event, learn how to navigate with the keyboard, or something. But the Web isn't a newspaper, nor is your site a magazine, through the Web's semantics and aesthetic design patterns have flourished from the consumption of print's rich tradition.

The point made in <a title="Debunking the Myth of the Page Fold in Web Design" href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2009/10/debunking_the_myth_of_the_page_fold_in_web_design/" target="_blank">Debunking the Myth of the Page Fold in Web Design</a> is a good one:
<blockquote>The key is to make sure there are no barriers that would make your users think there is no “below the fold” content. One example cited in the study had a large horizontal bar running across the page, which acted as a barrier — it looked like the bottom of the page even though it wasn’t. Eliminating the horizontal bar encourage users to scroll the page.
— <cite>Scott Gilbertson, Debunking the Myth of the Page Fold in Web Design</cite></blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am often unsettled when I glance at my "friend's list" only to stumble onto names not immediately familiar to me. Soon after, that guttural reaction to the unknown takes over. Sure, the program doesn't matter. My eyes wince, or I grimace. It is as if the name becomes a genuine presentation of the person, in the most literal way. We see them more and more often. Collections of texts, markings, signs. I s'pose, at least for my sake, more often than I see Sarah do I see "Sarah."

There are lesser unknowns and greater unknowns. We form positive physical attachment to those lesser. And physically shirk those greater. Hence, always take the lesser evil. Point is, such a principle seems nothing to do with our philosophizing, but rather with our hunting, living, roaming...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Often I find that others treat INTP as if it were some kind of <em>disorder</em>, as if "logical" treatment of problems is in some sense a fanatic's game, as if, instead of the assumption of "concentration," one is "cold" or "stoic." And usually the "problem" amounts to nothing more than a restatement of what INTP is (or subjectively seems), while the "solution" turns on ad hoc folk contrastive analysis of the "problem."

Regardless of the content of terms like "logical" and "cold," I believe there is an overarching, widely deployed notion of "autonomy," or perhaps "liberty" or maybe even "agency," largely conceptually confused (and this <em>goes without saying</em>, usually; see: Hume) which, in a peculiar way, I believe <em>frames </em>those INTP or INTP-like, in the minds of others, as being categorically less autonomous, given a supposed indebtedness to "logic," &amp;c. That is, a <em>metaphysical indebtedness</em> at all to something outside of one's self (where emotions are seen as, regardless of whether one can <em>control </em>them, <em>within </em>one's self; I believe anyone would say "one's emotions are external, in principle"). Perhap's it's all one sad category mistake. Whatever "logic" amounts to, say, it's nevertheless not <em>in </em>one's self, or something one controls. Consider Euthyphro.]]></content:encoded>

<pre>Words worldly enough, bitter enough and old enough, get evenly and repentfully enough;
Words well-formed enough and words whack'd savagely into catastrophe; words, well,
Words enough for me; And what if truth is what it is, nothing more, feel less enough those
Words woven against the chasms and crevices of every organ constituting all Whole
Words enough for you; And play pitiful and wrong on truth's cold weavings or prolong'd
Words absolved in the dusty shoes of a dried husk of a thought, some thought whose
Words wept with generations through; This or that fashionable atrocity subverting its
Words smashed beautifully into form; or post-back again every utterance before here;
Words enough will do; And again truth, somewhere along these lines must be admitt'd
Words alone may be hope enough lest the world be just that cold and old enough for
Words to merely show us some narration again and again, dry-eyed and scentless
Words enfeebled yet true; And truth again, or some other number, or world or two</pre>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I simply find it odd that so many people demand upfront sincerity in love, or this kind of blind flailing about into fast-forward emotion, a rejection of the Material and a dive into the pools of hearts, in a world riddled with neuroses, moral and religious blight, systematic psychological harms, global-technojargonization, a world inundated by abject sensationalism which seems only to exist with the intention to desensitize for the next big tragic oversight of our pallid civilization. People desperate to stay afloat in a world drowning in intellectual disease.

People are weak — weak.

Not strong; nor composed; not stable; not “with it” or in control, not free; rarely ever capable, and usually with reason; and perhaps systematically under-appreciated while over-stimulated. Why should [love], of all the rarest emotions, be made even further beyond apprehension in light of the wretch’d and pitiable state that is “being human”?

What reason do we have to assume that anyone is any better off in securing for themselves that one is indeed the lover that others need one to be, compared to, say, determining what one first must needs for oneself?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The other night someone called me a “stranger,” after I offered a ride. This person also has slept, and probably made out with some other person on my sofa. And knows this, knows that I know this, and possibly knows that I know that she knows this. — She had a four mile walk at 2 a.m. from the bar. The morning next I searched for her name on Google. When my mother missed a date, I searched hers as well. — But that’s the silliness of it, for who indeed knows what there is to know to arrive at a reasonable next step? And quite conspicuously she made a pass at me some other night before. Maybe it’s this city? Absurdity on every street corner. Indeed, the same night my life was threaten’d in a restroom because it’s impossible for not everybody to have the same information. Like how it’s impossible for certain outcomes to come to fruition given one’s future efforts, and this much is clear, and it is clear; <em>everything</em> here is obvious. Everything follows necessarily as it has before and nothing is a mystery, except the mundane and everyday. Seems, anyway. Maybe I just keep around too many people who’ve got it all figured out, as if there’s something to figure out, to have settled. It’s charming, for a spell; the surefire with no misfire. What better place to learn humility than in adulthood. All I’ve learn’d is that there isn’t anything funny about it, except what in principle should make one simply wish to scream.

If you’ve ever read <em>Neverwhere</em>: I feel like Richard, in the scene where he realizes that his ATM card no longer works, as if that is some kind of proof that he ever existed. I have these spells, wherein I feel to have slipped into the crack in the pavement between cousin dumpsters not seen each other in years, the crevice just forming webs in the attic of some house dreamt of by a child recently recovering from nightmares, the breaths unnoticed as music brings one into a dim morning world. But this is different. I’m fooling even myself in my promenades of self-assurance and established identity. The better half of the year, more or less, has been that panic-frenzy Richard underwent on the street as if a microcosm of everything Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar would put him through. Everything seems to be a terrible mess, and how many countless times — and if you know me at all, you know this — I have sat comfortably and with calm, ensuingly (word or not) entertain’d the countless reveries, rants, confessions, diatribes, etc. of my friends. Never have I felt so alienated and distant from, and I’ll point this out again sooner than later, everyone. I once emphatically attempt’d to persuade a very close-friend to read the <em>Sandman</em>, even physically exchanged the book — totally and utterly overlook’d it. Not pick’d up for any considerable length of time, or any length of time worth mentioning. At thoughts like this, I wonder what it means to be valuable. And why do I share with people, as I do? Systematic misfire — A piece of literature that I cherish’d, consign’d to the nethers and underrugs of some evening pregnant with nonsense and the nonmemerable. When should I start valuing anyone at all? My little cerebral world, filled with puzzles and world-word-play seems to interest no other. I feel as the space between others.

It feels like a switch; where everyone is set to “mild inconvenience, but nonpunishable and hardly noticeable” and I’m left wondering. For instance, my moral friend decided that the best time to become my moral judge is after I’ve taken to the bottle. I said something to myself the other day, or the other week: “Don’t look for moral virtue under the bar.” And as if I have everything to be grateful for; as if I’m wrong in my positions, it seems every single one. Lately my skeptical auto-pilot has been full-on; hell, I can hardly sleep without imaging (not “imagining,” for this lacks the detail to which my mind transcribes the emotional terror) my landlord, who I know very little about, rushing into my easily penetrable home to slash me indecipherable.

(And who better to say it? Why shouldn’t it be said? Perpetuating what? In the face of the grimmest image what can language do that is worse? Well, my language haunts me incessantly. It tries. If you think I’m overly wordy and often off-topic, consider how I feel about all of this. Then, what loneliness must mean. No shortage comes to this blathering simply because you aren’t around. Filled with images, disgust, bile of all sorts match’d with wit, eloquence, innocence and flame (and I’m mentioning here, for wont to claim narcissism) — indeed, it has come to the point where only this schism inside me, or perhaps this projection, have it as you will, and its verbosity can match the value of my deepest concerns. Most others ask me about the latest shows, or the proverbial “what’s up?” — if you don’t know, and you do, I’m not going to play some language game with you, on your terms; not to doesn’t entail that I do, incontrovertibly, require a shrink. — What is my language? — My face? Where I am? The boundless expression of my wit? Linguistic constructions sewn together from loosely connected memories of the yesterday before the time you once rode a pony into a ditch? — You’re talking about nothing in particular, as you might readily and jadedly admit, so why should I muster the energy to engage in a waste of idle phonetic markers indicating ultimately that we lack common interest?)

Just in case you were unclear on what prompt’d this message. I have other motives; chief of them being that I’ve simply had enough. Even if I’m not entitled to lashing out, I’m going to do exactly this. Much of grief follows a dictum of simply “let the person be.” I’ve received not only this, but, out of some odd result, oversight. Never have I felt so remote from almost every person I’ve ever encountered in my life. Various of them talk my head off about things any person in their right mind, knowing the circumstances I am in, should know I am incapable of finding interest for. It feels as if I’ve stumbled into a small theatre room where on repeat is a broken reel of some child handing a lollipop to a widow at a funeral. Others in the know are painting me out to be a bomb, and others who are not seem simply twist’d or human.

Perhaps I did this to myself (Can anybody read me? Even here? Doubtful.), or perhaps someone or something else is culpable, but the short of it is, I’m sick of weeping alone, drinking with people who are more interest’d in crowd-pleasing and keeping the thing that we had a minute ago before the beginning of the last bottle on that thing about the exam regarding the concept of the story tomorrow. One of my acquaintances even tried to sneak in a tangentially related joke about death into polite conversation. He eyeball’d me throughout the “conversation point processing” moment of silence — contrived laughter ensures; like a child who drops a plate, or the other thing, or that one time, whose eyes become glued to entrances and mysterious corners, stares blankly and dim-witted into the face of fear or the Father. As if I’m some kind of test bed for emotions. At my first feel for death, at its first genuine tug, I’m in a mind-field of tinkerers and rampant conversationalists. And all, again, as if, as so, like so, etc., I somehow must face a dilemma: Either I stay lock’d up with thoughts which only engender rage and insanity where I do not undermine the social norms, whatever they may be (because when someone asks you “what’s up?”, don’t be impolite! Respond with a cheer!), or walk about, leaving my emotions to take me as they will ‘til I’m reprimanded for emoting too hard, too extremely at the cost of others. Who really wants to talk the issue here? Indeed? Who wants to discuss the details? Who, even, is prepared to discussed such a topic with such manifest gravity? I certainly do not, of course, but I certainly do not wish to be treat’d as if a test-subject or as if I’ve obviously reached certain conclusions, emotional or otherwise, despite <em>not</em> having expressed or vocalized them. It’s like watching a football game where every receiver fumbles, but for some reason, the coaches play on. Another fumble. And another. Football isn’t interesting, but that should be a game to see! Logically no different from hitting, as a reflex, the “same keys”: “pdawouojihsarnfshf” on the keyboard in that hurry to save some abject porn video.

Another presumed friend informed me that I’m “being analyzed”. <em>This</em> is what you say to someone grieving? Or not? There has to be a right answer here? Or not? Does this end? Or not? — Every turn I’m being toss’d curve balls with no clear intention of winning, an object, any old object should do!, except to revel in the curveballishness of the curveballitude. And then someone says something else. Exactly. Here’s another idiom.

(If you’re reading this and you feel that you in some way are directly connected to some of my conclusions or ramblings, or at worst, feel offended, you must understand that, at this point, your opinion on the matter no longer interests me, whoever you are. How did I get to this point? Well, admittedly I “gave up,” to whatever extent this may mean, when recent events passed by some odd stroke of linguistic anguish came to be described, and once at all should itself be a sin, as a “ceremony.” Look, let’s play a game: Think of ceremonies, with the waving and mindless glee, usual occasional dance, the word “celebration” comes to mind, the intention to celebrate; so scratch all of that. But what of the verbal component? There must be one, indeed? And what must one say to death? Why must one say anything at all? And in fashion? Never have I witness’d such in apropos. Every revisit to the thought strikes me like a cell guard. 5 times used; 5 times —

It has become obvious that I have pinned myself to a wall, and there may be little of a dignified alternative. I’ve certainly given no one any reason not to take a “hands off” approach. But in the past couple of weeks, I’ve drunk myself into oblivion, slept in the rankest of piles, walked the streets aimless for hours on end, cursed myself repeatedly with suicide and put cigarettes out on my thighs and arms. For no good reason either, or perhaps as a means to organize the emotions I’ve been dealt, but one thing is clear: I don’t get along with most people nor do I like most people, and it’s obvious to most of them most of the time. (Plus, “most” people would not read this entire message, and not out of lack of interest. My language is pinned to the wall.) In attempting to hide my obviously rank disposition, as I usually do, I’ve fooled myself into believing that it’s not true. Exciting.

But now it’s obvious to me. That said, unfollow at will. I have no shame. Primarily because I don’t have anyone else — and I sincerely want anyone who would be inclined to shout “get help”: first off, one would likely only say this to someone one knows personally, very personally. That said, stop. Imagine, just imagine what such a conversation would look like. Is it not obvious that I would spend every bit of energy that I can muster in attempt to undermine and shatter not only the doctrine but the person as well? Have I given any reason to believe I don’t have such ammo? (This is the bit about feeling alienated. Either I’m an ass or I’m a complete buffoon at this point.) When I’m backed into a corner (or trapped in a bottle, as Wittgenstein would have it), which is what the whole subtext of therapy is, I will doggedly and ruthlessly attack; you know this. You do. Lock me in a room with someone for argument? I honestly cannot imagine sincere reflection on the possible outcomes has come to anyone who has ever suggested this advice to me; the crux of the point is this: if you’re really a pomo and all of that, where you gaze into the dimmest of installations expressing the vacuity of art as its message and find aesthetic solace in the pitiable moral bankruptcy of Miller or Bukowski, the untethered pseudo-pseudo-intellectual anthropology of the intellectual deceit of the 20th century à la Joyce or Beckett, if you praise the pain and inhale again knowing the ground-floor absurdity of your lifestyle, you will shirk immediately the notion that the Shrink is a blessing, for why should blessings exist at all? In accepting the Shrink, I accept that there is some right answer to any of this, that there is something which is “correct” for me … It’s all too suspiciously teleological; why can’t a mess just be a mess? And why shouldn’t the person who made it, or rather whose doorstep it appear’d on, clean it up? I don’t feel right. Yes, every morning, or some 3 a.m. I’m turn’d up with the need to vomit. The world less sanitary as a whole, and the idea of predicting anything beyond my hands comes off as a audacious effort at tying my own shoes. And yes, I’m supposed to feel that way. To say the least, it’s not obvious one way or the other; I’ve even had one person suggest medicine: as a response to grief! Unbelievable this country we live in, to some even grief is an error —, oh, and talking to my walls isn’t as productive, as the end of this rant shall again note.)

“Always good to network!” — Why would anyone actually believe this? Is it true? False? What does such a thing, assuming its thingness, “picture” as it were? It certainly isn’t true for the aristocracy, under some social cases, and it certainly is hardly relevant, in the capitalistic fashion, for the homeless and downtrodden. — Is it Platonism?

I came across a foolish looking website, something seeming to date back to ‘94 in terms of usability and style. Haphazard, wrong, clashing, illogical. Whatever the case, it proffer’d the notion that forcing one to live through what is an undignified physical effort (say, life-support, etc. under certain conditions) follows from the “monstrosity” of the medical industry. — Humans are indeed peculiar; moral for moral, toe for toe.

It has become apparent to me that there is a certain requirement of “being social”; namely that one express interest and concern for the other, but what’s more that one minimally initiates “fun.” As if some peculiar gestalt; being social is the name, but “fun” seems to truly capture what “being social” is about. We often demand of user interfaces, branding, designs, concepts, etc., that they be “fun,” where “fun” is often ill-defined and petty, cheap, inane, in the end — a ragtag collection of niceties. Arrows pointing scatter’d; arbitrary noises; stream of consciousness confessionalism; sophisticated banter riddled with non-jokes for the sake of saying what one said — that’s all I’m sayin’; indeed, and it’s all a fuck’s worth of fun. Of course, all of this is qualified with that one is physically present to some extent, sociality being curtail’d by physical distance. All old news, I s’pose, but it’s upsetting. This reminds me of the accounts in an essay in the anthology, <em>Language and the Social Context</em>, of the Apache people and how they dealt with “being sad.” The section on the matter isn’t well-written and the quotes are too narrow for generalization, in themselves, but the gist given is that the Apache people understood that one usually took solitude as a means to coping with death. This meant keeping to one’s close quarters, perhaps one’s “rounds.” In my case, I’ve decided to venture on, as normal, as is demanded by both job and social obligation, yet in the end, I’ve lost out. Apparently I know no grief. Perhaps it’s this crowd; perhaps it’s this city, but the most absurd thing has happened, it seems that it has become unanimous that I am simply cold and, perhaps, a shell of a person. Persistent has this theme been: there’s not much going on behind what I bring to the present. As if I’m unphased. It’s quite unbelievable. Anyone initiated to the facts of the matter should hardly believe that anything less than suicide or drastic, violent retaliation count as the best coping mechanisms —

But nothing so extreme. I’m simply “doing well.” I’m not sure how I convinced anyone of this. And it certainly makes continued interaction undesirable and markedly disingenuous; period.

Well, well, perhaps I did this to myself? Perhaps this is what coping for me amounts to, as one of my professor’s would begrudgingly have it. Well, that was about truth, but what isn’t true or not or is but true then true is not what is. That’s a trick! I’ve managed my public grief in such a way as to demonstrate no grief at all! — It’s human magic.

Simply being physically present, under certain contexts, suggests to many people, it seems, that one is of a certain mental order. How is this any different from Cartesian dualism? And why do so many people mock him when this pernicious mode of thought, this asinine dualism, persists and unfolds itself at every turn? (Likely because they never actually read Descartes, I’ll assume; why chase ghosts?)

I often dislike noting people of my Spinozism, and that is usually for the fact that in the name alone it seems, or should seem, perhaps, that I find most kinds of dualist thought, which seem to infect most kinds of personas, characters, etc., of people, who roam the streets, the shops, the offices and the social stratosphere, freakish and conceptually unhygienic.

Often this empty house’s offer isn’t much inferior to the vapidity of human experience. But at least I can effectively hide here.

This ride has been one platitude after another, a fantastic overrun of platitudes — I’m reminded of the Odyssey Ed. illustration of “Overrun” —, and I’m sure I deserve it.

Most people make being myself around them an insufferable experience.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Only becoming more difficult to get up as days pass. And sleep holds like beer. I’m to the point of drinking ‘til I find the right &amp; chance opportunity to perform virtuous acts for strangers. Doesn’t help looking as I do; being so twitchy and absent-minded, something like a crack’d pontificator. Frenetic ramblings only to preserve some feeling that social experience has value. Half blind most days, which may change soon, but doubtless it should matter as I must feel disengaged from people, to this extent, for a reason. Idle speculation in the unfolding moments of my day have taken over. Mind becoming unwieldy &amp; constrictive; people less clear, less compelling.]]></content:encoded>

Walls all around you 
Every morning;
The walls don’t change
So why should you?

And that person, sitting 
As if cradled beside you, 
Who means absolutely anything 
To you, or nothing absolutely, 
Who whispers through fibers

Unawares, lines that pierce the rain, 
The wall of noise, 
The constancy of never change — 
That person shewing you 
The rain and the wall are impossible</pre>]]></content:encoded>

We were so young; I don't deserve to be this old.<br />
Once, you said of me, "she's the nicest person, but it's really hard to make her smile".<br />

What happened to us? 
We share a face, but I don't see it anymore.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm rolling in laughter and disgust. Literally shuddering, shaking physically at this mode of thought.

He refers to her funeral as "the thing." And when he got all self-righteous and indignant a month or so ago, after his sister's birthday, vocally attacking me, for being a "downer" to social events, etc. because my job was on the line, I had been arrested, among various other incidents, he responds, after I call him out on it, "That shit that happened like 10 months ago? (long pause suggesting that this is a fair time-frame)"

I find the idea that someone's death "resets" all the social history between people who happen to be connected with the deceased to be the most abominable idea. Suddenly someone's death redefines all kinds of moderate indecency between people? How does this logic even begin to work? It's all trivial when compared to someone's death, apparently.  "When compared"? What on earth is that? Is that even English? How did this trash get into my language? What has anyone's death got to do with me smashing someone's window in with a baseball? Committing adultery? Unjustly or not, attacking someone verbally? Why should I even begin to conjoin these thoughts with that of the death of a cherished one? It's not "trivial by comparison." There is no comparison, unless the word couches some deeper thought. The idea of comparison simply does not fit. I am now to take the death of some person and apply a utilitarian-style calculated comparison against all other "events" in social life. Someone's death is not just some other thing or happening, some other note in the song, some other line in the sonnet of life, or whatever pernicious diminution. I don't nor do I want to parade about, claiming my Kantianism, but whatever <em>that </em>is I everywhere I can, in whatever conversation I participate in, <em>must </em>make clear that I not only disagree with it, but I despise it. And I think it will be one of the principle causes for the ruination of our culture. <em>I hate the utilitarian mode of thought. </em>It is <em>morally disgusting.</em>

I change my tune. It's not poetry, in my experience, but poets that should be removed from the Republic. I believe I have come closer to a true interpretation of this work.
<blockquote>"Books, records, films — these things matter. Call me shallow but it's the fuckin' truth."

<cite>— Rob, <em>High Fidelity</em></cite></blockquote>
I'll explicitly add to this, though it is entailed, but it definitely ties the bow on, I believe, an entire phase of my life which I am now resolved and comfortable to put behind me: Words.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Books, records, films, and words — these things matter. Call me shallow but it's the fuckin' truth.</p>
Poets cannot let you have <em>your meaning</em>. This is why I despise poetry.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A house is not a home</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll keep this short and sweet, since I have actual fish to fry. Or maybe not. But it's worth it. Trust me. And if you can, feel offended, I don't give two, and pass it on. (Tracy Morgan style: "That's a meta-metanym.")

Two close friends, Min and K(c)it, have come to the opinion that my "attitude" is sour. And it brings the party down. And so on. Lost job. Got arrested. Girlfriend problematics. Et cetera. Put my pedantry first. Who gives two about the order. Rejoinder: that's my fucking house too. <em>My home</em>. (Do I need to extract the idea that their perception of me is inevitably going to be colored by their experiences with me at home? Next you'll say, "Well, they know how to distinguish between the two different Aaron's." I hope your degree in psychoanalysis, or whatever drivel philosophy you train yourself in saves you. But I am <em>not</em> going to argue that bullshit. It's <em>my home</em>. If you cannot understand that, god help you. That I should have to point this out: god help you. That it should be overlooked: you're an bloody fucking buffoon.) And others have most certainly extended their own opinions from the aforementioned. Is it my fault everyone defined <em>that</em> house as a "party house"? Did <em>I</em> invite you in? Drinking <em>my beer</em>, forming <em>those opinions</em>? Why "my beer"? Because by legal definition, <em>my home</em> has become a bar, or a private place, whatever's non-public, or fuck's sake whatever counts. I'm not sure what tortured logical acumen allows one to think that one shouldn't lick one's wounds at one's only place of recovery, repair, restitution… (And if your conclusion is, "That's not my aesthetic. It's an <em>unattractive</em> way of dealing with one's problems. That's not how I would 'lick my wounds,' as you put it," then fuck you. Actually, simply put, <em>what the fuck is wrong with you</em>? Exactly those words; generate the proposition if your wit can allow it. But I cannot help one swamped in such conceitedness. Or better yet: Get the fuck out.) But I'll ask the obvious question, turning on that notion of obviousness which some of my friends have come to hate.

Which principle should I adopt? Maintain face for social grace, or salvage one's dignity where most certainly no one can kick one when one is down?

And in the same token that one might argue: "That's what you signed up for by moving into the party house." The only response to that is ridicule, I firmly believe; I really think you should re-think such a position. But nevertheless, fine. Again: <em>My home. </em>Do you understand what this means? Run the categorical imperative for all I care. When you sign up as a roommate, don't air dirty laundry directly or indirectly. Fair? Fine, not fair? Not at all clear to me why, but shouldn't that apply those extending their own opinions from those who are in-the-home? Or at least take that into consideration when forming such new opinions? So I "went too far"? "Ranted for too long"? Again: <em>My Home. </em>How is this any different from the conclusion: "That isn't how I'd handle my issues [at home]."

And if you're ready to assert that I was <em>totally</em> consumed, that I was unjustified in being <em>that</em> upset, I'd first ask you re-assess your understanding of empathy. Or perhaps the "unattractive" bit again. Because I was in a bad way, you know it, and relative to the sum total experiences we shared while I was in a bad way (and I will tell you again, <em>systematic headaches</em>, family continuing to fall apart, <em>real threat</em> of zero job opportunity, etc.), do you even want to come close to "totally consumed"? Or should I ask you to distinguish those opinions you formed either directly or indirectly from <em>in my home </em>with those formed after I <em>doggedly hunted</em> you down to spill all of my problems into you? (I hope you're not so infuriated by now to be incapable of perceiving sarcasm. You know me, I'm always a one-way street. I never listen. Need I go on?)

In other words: Betrayal.

If you cannot understand that; if all you can be is postmodern offended by these deductions, we should not have been friends to begin with. Thanks for wasting my time. I learned <em>nothing</em> from you. (And if you fail to see that the <em>if </em>tracks those sentences subsequent to the first, that it is implied, if your let your emotions fail to incorporate such an interpretation, then all the same.)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This</em> is called <em>bereavement</em>. And if you do not perceive (not "understand") this, and you should not <em>absolutely (</em>I say this because others, <em>some others</em> seem rubbed that I demand such <em>understanding</em>, as if I am requesting, expecting this, as opposed to <em>simple conversation</em> with due care in words and wit, mindfulness and grace on the matter, and perhaps other matters -- Is this, I sincerely ask, so much to ask, even for a spell? -- Say, that it should first be understood why my behavior has changed at all, which entails an understanding of why it is that I embrace those familiar to me less, as if it would be some kind of surprise.<em>)</em>, as <em>this</em> one must believe bears <em>some measure</em> of inscrutability, inexpressability, and as yet, if you know <em>me</em>:

"Worüber man nicht reden kann, darüber muss man schreiben."

And to those who feel I should obviously <em>pour être capable de maintenir</em>, I should be ineffectual in asking you to consult empathy, as your moral bearing, I can only assume, is <em>other-worldly</em>, perhaps even sociopathic, or perhaps your language has been sutured to madness (-- but I have nothing left in me to explain, as now I fear malnutrition and insomnia, the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bnkprime/6063500202/in/photostream">voices</a> in my head, night-terrors, and so on have given me real, obstinate fear for my own well-being; and all I wish is to work, create, and <em>breathe, </em>despite whatever ambiguously disingenuous, rarely less than identical to practice in obscurantism and skepticism, amateurs académiques, grandiose, obdurate and stagnant psychoanalytic-slash-postmodern hubris-flatulence, along with appendum ad nauseum notes on suicide, as "support" and "commiseration," the older part of my "friend group" has proffered):

((Because, I have only <em>one question: </em>What if you are <em>wrong? -- What if your analysis is simply wrong? What have you lost in attempting to confirm it? Can you even confirm it? And why </em>must <em>you not? </em>Where does that put me, given <em>your distance</em> and utter rejection of verification? — And if your response is: "Haha! This cannot be real!"; What else can I say but that I genuinely hope you die in a gas fire; I severely doubt you understand the first thing about what it means to be human (as a social animal); or you're just a complete idiot who somehow managed to convince people of mastered literacy and even grade school intelligence.))

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[And with that. A very dear and close friend's <em>first words</em>:

"I honestly wouldn't know how to handle the death of someone close to me, or how to comfort someone else who is grieving. Perhaps you could enlighten me on what you feel or what I, as someone who is not you, could offer you or should be expected to do."

Stunning. Sublime. That such is possible.

My response, or say "analysis":

I say this -- that such is possible -- because, of course, perhaps "of course," I have been toiling, on and on, more of that grieving business. Bereavement, if you will. And at my last smoke break, I reflected on all of the responses I have received, from [no response] to psychoanalysis to skepticism and probing to ridicule to avoidance to utter forgetfulness as <strong>first response</strong>. But one response nagged me the most. As it pulled at my training as a philosopher. It was like "what would you have me say?" but it was framed as "what if were you in my shoes?" And it came not first, but after some argument. It came off totally insincere. It was more like "what would <em>you </em>say to someone like you?" Which in my mind sounds utterly evil. Asking a grieving person to consider how to mend him or herself. Of course, and I believe this "of course" is valid. <em>If I should know that, I would have done it been now. </em>And now I do have that answer. I would say, more or less, exactly what you said. Yet as a grieving person <em>I </em>cannot say it. Me saying this to myself does not count. And being incapable of such an answer is inadmissible to me. Posing that question though, "what would you say to yourself" however does not deserve reward of anything, in my mind. Because, well, <em>you </em>actually said it. This is what I mean by: <em>That such is possible. </em>I did not say it. And it is only possible that I might. And so, reminding me that it is possible deserves nothing. However a grieving person needs a certain something, I feel, that is concrete. And what you said is concrete. Real. Particular, explicit, actual, existing, in response, and genuine. Not a struggle to understand, but simply understanding. And I have lived most of my life by this rule: "Do not weep. Do not wax indignant. Understand." The author means "struggle to understand." But in rare cases, I firmly believe, it must means not "attempt" but simply "have that understanding as such." And this understanding that I believe you expressed to me is the acknowledgement that one does not understand. Not, absolutely not, that one should struggle, or be permitted to struggle. But simply that one <em>is in fact in the grips of a struggle. </em>This is what your words meant to me.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Top 5 Greatest Albums for Rigorous Study of Human Relationships</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Top 5 Greatest Albums for Rigorous Study of Human Relationships. In no particular order; or maybe one will strike me. Polvo: Celebrate the New Dark Age EP. Merge. '94. Or something like that. Oh, right. <em>And one other thing.</em>

At significant moments in my friendships with others, where sincerity and wherewithal to engage in open steadfast dialogue of Self, selves, identities, and all that, for the first time, as a kind of baptism into seasoned companion, rare indeed, for just about anyone, but nevertheless possible, it is confessed that indeed one of my most valued qualities is the expressive and "animated" nature of my personality, in speech, ranging from Wittgenstein to the historical underpinnings of contemporary Analytic philosophy, under the rancors of the nuance often opaque in existentialisms, bad faiths, Satre's name pronounced in American English, Saussure's signs and other silliness, radical politics, the science of love, and on and on next to the shit I slept next to in jail. And then I'm accused of rationalism, or coldness, or something else turning on this double standard. -- "Don't be too expressive! And be expressive <em>always </em>as I see fit! I have sensibilities too, y'know!"

<em>When do I get a say in how you ought to interpret me?</em>

I might get loud. And the point about my race is that <em>it all counts so long as you're going to stick to this abstraction called </em>expression. It's constituted by <em>all of my properties. </em>And the perception of race in this country if willingly rejected; if one hurriedly seeks to reject or abstain from such mode of thinking; one moronically fails in understanding the historical underpinnings of this country we live in. It is not <em>pancultural </em>just yet. It is a total mess of interconnected histories and ethnicities of trial and tribulation. To willing oversee this is not a principle I should adopt for myself. I don't see why anyone should expect me to. But nevertheless: <em>This </em>is what it means to be me. <em>This </em>is how I express myself, all the way down the vertical organization of my emotional capacities.

And to tell me that any of it is unattractive is to leave me unclear on where stand. And if you think I didn't see such an evaluation months before you did, any single one of you, then you must not have been paying attention to the moments where I am most silent. You call yourselves <em>analysts! </em>

In the end, you have to ask yourself, given this double standard: Did he ever viciously and without reason ever attack me? Call me an "idiot"? Simply insult me or present a kind of gross, toxic apathy that seems incapable of apprehending any interest whatsoever? Simply dismiss me? Has he ever been unclear and totally divorced so much as to leave no entry or exit? Has his language ever given to waving and the rancid, dogmatic idiom of our age, into the cliche of the multitude's thought, into obstinant blind ignorance? Has he ever not driven you to express yourself in a way that even if cumbersome and unappealing, manages to help manage what may be obscured by quite palpable human error.

I may be expressive, and that's because I need to be... And you can probably rot in hell, or Montrose, or whatever city's your fancy. -- Third track, Tragic Carpet Ride, makes it all pretty damn clear. Remember? I'm the guy with over 300 gigabytes of music<em>:</em>

looking for the story of another disbeliever
fascinated eyes open wide
every opportunity the eager receiver
tracing every step outside
don't back away from me now
there's a strategy i'm willing to use
stand in my path and i will state
cause there's some shit that i'm willing to lose
i won't get out
i'd rather burn
i won't trust scarred survivors
and i will never learn
tell me that you understand
tell me why you look concerned
tell me that you know
or i will never learn

Ash Bowie "shouts" all of it. Or so it seems.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is the peculiar genius of the French to express their philosophical thought in aphorisms, sayings hard and tight as diamonds, each one the crystal centre of a whole constellation of ideas. Thus, the entire scheme of seventeenth century intellectual rationalism may be said to branch out from that single, pregnant saying of Descartes, ‘Cogito ergo sum’ – ‘I think, therefore I am.’ Resistentialism, the philosophy which has swept present-day France, runs true to this aphoristic form. Go into any of the little cafés or horlogeries on Paris’s Left Bank (make sure the Seine is flowing away from you, otherwise you’ll be on the Right Bank, where no one is ever seen) and sooner or later you will hear someone say, ‘Les choses sont contre nous.’ ‘Things are against us.’

This is the nearest English translation I can find for the basic concept of Resistentialisin, the grim but enthralling philosophy now identified with bespectacled, betrousered, two-eyed Pierre-Marie Ventre. In transferring the dynamic of philosophy from man to a world of hostile Things,’ Ventre has achieved a major revolution of thought, to which he himself gave the name ‘Resistentialism’. Things (res) resist (résister) man (homme, understood). Ventre makes a complete break with traditional philosophic method. Except for his German precursors, Freidegg and Heidansiecker, all previous thinkers from the Eleatics to Marx have allowed at least some legitimacy to human thought and effort. Some, like Hegel or Berkeley, go so far as to make man’s thought the supreme reality. In the Resistentialist cosmology that is now the intellectual rage of Paris Ventre offers us a grand vision of the Universe as One Thing – the Ultimate Thing (Dernière Chose). And it is against us.

Two world wars have led to a general dissatisfaction with the traditional Western approach to cosmology, that of scientific domination. In Ventre’s view, the World-Thing, to which he sometimes refers impartially as the Thing-World, opposes man’s partial stealing, as it were, of consciousness – of his dividing it into the separate ‘minds’ with which human history has made increasingly fatal attempts to create a separate world of men. Man’s increase in this illusory domination over Things has been matched, pari passu, by the increasing hostility (and greater force) of the Things arrayed against him. Medieval man, for instance, had only a few actual Things to worry about – the lack of satisfactory illumination at night, the primitive hole in the roof blowing the smoke back and letting the rain in, and one or two other small Things like that. Modern, domesticated Western man has far more opportunities for battle-losing against Things – can-openers, collar-studs, chests of drawers, open manholes, shoelaces . . . .

Now that Ventre has done it for us, it is easy to see that the reaction against nineteenth-century idealism begun by Martin Freidegg and Martin Heidansiecker was bound eventually to coalesce with the findings of modern physics in a philosophical synthesis for our time. Since much stress has been laid on the ‘scientific’ basis of Resistentialism, it will not be out of place here, before passing on to a more detailed outline of Ventre’s thought, to give a brief account of those recent developments in physical science which have so blurred the line that separates it from metaphysics. It is an account which will surprise those whose acquaintance with Ventre is limited to reading reviews of his plays and who, therefore, are apt to think that – -

Resistentialism is largely a matter of sitting inside a wet sack and moaning.

A convenient point of departure is provided by the famous Clark-Trimble experiments of 1935. Clark-Trimble was not primarily a physicist, and his great discovery of the Graduated Hostility of Things was made almost accidentally. During some research into the relation between periods of the day and human bad temper, Clark-Trimble, a leading Cambridge psychologist, came to the conclusion that low human dynamics in the early morning could not sufficiently explain the apparent hostility of Things at the breakfast table – the way honey gets between the fingers, the unfoldability of newspapers, etc. In the experiments which finally confirmed him in this view, and which he demonstrated before the Royal Society in London, Clark-Trimble arranged four hundred pieces of carpet in ascending degrees of quality, from coarse matting to priceless Chinese silk. Pieces of toast and marmalade, graded, weighed, and measured, were then dropped on each piece of carpet, and the marmalade-downwards incidence was statistically analysed. The toast fell right-side-up every time on the cheap carpet, except when the cheap carpet was screened from the rest (in which case the toast didn’t know that Clark-Trimble had other and better carpets), and it fell marmalade-downwards every time on the Chinese silk. Most remarkable of all, the marmalade- downwards incidence for the intermediate grades was found to vary exactly with the quality of carpet.

The success of these experiments naturally switched Clark-Trimble’s attention to further research on resistentia, a fact which was directly responsible for the tragic and sudden end to his career when he trod on a garden rake at the Cambridge School of Agronomy. In the meantime, Noys and Crangenbacker had been doing some notable work in America. Noys carried out literally thousands of experiments, in which subjects of all ages and sexes, sitting in chairs of every conceivable kind, dropped various kinds of pencils. In only three cases did the pencil come to rest within easy reach. Crangenbacker’s work in the social- industrial field, on the relation of human willpower to specific problems such as whether a train or subway will stop with the door opposite you on a crowded platform, or whether there will be a mail box anywhere on your side of the street, was attracting much attention.

Resistentialism, a sombre, post-atomic philosophy of pagan, despairing nobility, advocates complete withdrawal from Things. Now that Ventre has done the thinking for us it is easy to see how the soil was being prepared for Resistentialism in the purely speculative field by the thought of Martin Freidegg (1839- 1904) and Martin Heidansiecker (1850-1910), both well known anti- idealists and anti-intellectualists. It is in the latter’s Werke (Works) published at Tübingen in 1894, that the word Resistentialismus first appears, although it has not the definite meaning assigned to it by Ventre. It is now possible to trace a clear line of development to Ventre from Goethe, who said, with prophetic insight into the hostility of one Thing, at least, ‘Three times has an apple proved fatal. First to the human race in the fall of Adam; secondly to Troy, through the gift of Paris; and last of all, to science through the fall of Newton’s apple’ (Werke, XVI, 17). Later we find Heidansiecker’s concept of Dingenhass, the hatred of Things. But in the confused terminology of this tortured German mystic we are never sure whether it is Things who hate us, or we who hate the Things.

To the disillusioned youth of post-war France there was an immediate appeal in Ventre’s relentlessly logical concept of man’s destiny as a néant, or No-Thing, and it was the aesthetic expression of this that gave Resistentialism such great popular currency outside the philosophical textbooks. Ventre himself is an extraordinarily powerful dramatist; his first play, Puits Clos, concerns three old men who walk ceaselessly round the bottom of a well. There are also some bricks in the well. These symbolize Things, and all the old men hate the bricks as much as they do each other. The play is full of their pitiful attempts to throw the bricks out of the top of the well, but they can, of course, never throw high enough, and the bricks always fall back on them. Puits Clos has only recently been taken off at the little Theatre Jambon to make room for another Resistentialist piece by Blanco del Huevo, called Comment sont les choses? Del Huevo is an ardent young disciple of Ventre, and in this play, which is also running in London under the title The Things That Are Caesar, he makes a very bold step forward in the application of Resistentialist imagery to the theatre. He has made Things the characters, and reduced the human beings to what are known in Resistentialist language as Poussés. The nearest English translation that suggests itself for this philosophical term is ‘pushed- arounds’.

The chief ‘characters’ in Comment sont les choses? are thus a piano and a medicine cabinet; attached to the piano is Poussé Number One – no human beings are given actual names, because names are one of the devices by which man has for so long blinded himself to his fundamental inability to mark himself out from the Universe (Dernière Chose). Poussé Number One is determined to play the piano, and the piano is determined to resist him. For the first twenty minutes of Act I, he plays a Beethoven sonata up to a certain bar, which always defeats him. He stops, and plays this bar over a hundred times, very slowly. He gets it right. He begins the sonata again and when he gets to this bar he makes the very same mistake. He pours petrol on the piano and is just about to set it on fire when he hears a huge crash from the bathroom, also visible to the audience on the other side of a stage partition.

All this time the medicine cabinet has been resisting the attempts of Poussé Number Two to fix it on the wall, and it has now fallen into the bath. Poussé Number One who is in love, naturally, with Poussé Number Two’s wife, Poussée, mimes his derision at the woeful lack of manhood of one who cannot even dominate Things to the extent of fixing a medicine cabinet. While he does so, the piano, with the tragic irony of a Greek chorus, speaks of Poussé Number One’s own hubris and insolence in imagining that he can master the piano. Poussé Number Two is too busy to retaliate, as he is sweeping up the mess of camphorated oil, essence of peppermint, hair cream, calamine lotion, and broken glass towards the plug end of the bath, meaning to swill them out with hot water. He is desperately anxious to get this done before Poussée arrives home. She comes, however, while he is still trying ignominiously to get the bits of glass off one sticky hand with the other sticky hand, the glass then sticking to the other sticky hand and having to be got off with the first sticky hand (a good example of choses co-rélatives in the Resistentialist sense). Poussée expresses her scorn and asks her husband, all in mime, why he can’t play the piano like Poussé Number One (who has persuaded her that he can). Eventually she goes out with Poussé Number One, and Poussé Number Two, exhausted by his labours at the bath, falls into it and into a deep coma.

Act II is extremely unconventional, and although some critics have hailed it as a great attempt to break down the modern separation between players and audience it seems to me to be the weakest part of the play, the nearest to a mere philosophical treatise. The curtain simply goes up on a Resistentialist exhibition, and the audience are invited to walk round. While they are examining the exhibits, which contain not only Resistentialist paintings but also what Ventre as well as Del Huevo calls objets de vie (chests of drawers, toothpaste caps, collar buttons, etc.), the stage manager comes on in his shirt sleeves and reads the chapter on sex from Ventre’s Résistentialisme. Ventre takes a tragic view, of sex, concerned as it is with the body, by which the World-Thing obtains its mastery over human territory. In so far as man is not merely a body he is only a pseudo-Thing (pseudo-chose), a logical ‘monster’. Ventre sees woman, with her capacity for reproduction indefinitely prolonging this state of affairs, as the chief cause of humanity’s present dilemma of Thing-separation and therefore Thing-warfare. Love between humans, i.e. between Man (Not-woman) and Woman (Notman), perpetuates bodies as Things, because a man, in being a Not-woman, shows the capacity of all things for being only one Thing (it is all much clearer in the French, of course). Just as a man is a Not- woman, he is also a Not-sideboard, a Not-airplane. But this is as far as man can go in Thing-ness, and if it were not for women we could all die and be merged comfortably in the Universe or Ultimate Thing.

In Act III, the action, if one can call it that, is resumed. When the curtain goes up Poussé Number Two is discovered still lying in the bath. The tragedy of man’s futile struggle against the power of Things begins to draw towards its fatal climax as we hear a conversation between the piano and the medicine cabinet in which the piano suggests an exchange of their respective Poussés. The piano, realizing that Poussée doesn’t know anything about music anyway and will probably accept Poussé Number One’s word that he can play, queering the pitch for Things, with this ambivalent concept of love, wishes to lure Number Two on instead. (In Ventre’s system, Things are quite capable of emanations and influences by reason of their affinity with man’s Thing-Body or Not-other.) Accordingly, when Poussé Number Two wakes up in the bath he feels a compulsive desire to play the piano, forgetting that his fingers are still sticky – and of course it is not his piano anyway. The piano, biding its time, lets him play quite well. (In Resistentialist jargon, which unashamedly borrows from the terminology of Gonk and others when necessary, the resistance of the I-Thing is infinite and that of the Thou-Thing is zero – it is always my bootlaces that break and of course Poussé Number Two thinks he is playing Poussé Number One’s piano.) Number Two only leaves the instrument when he hears the others coming back. He goes to the bathroom and listens through the partition with a knowing smile as Poussé Number One begins to play for Poussée. Naturally, his fingers stick to the keys, the piano being an I-Thing for him, or so he thinks. This makes Poussé Number Two feel so good that he actually manages to fix the medicine cabinet. Poussée, returning to him disillusioned from the pseudo-pianist, flings herself into his arms, but it is too late. He has cut an artery on a piece of the broken glass sticking out of the medicine cabinet. In despair she rushes back to the music room, where Poussé Number One has just lit a cigarette to console himself and think out the next move. (‘As if that mattered,’ says the piano scornfully.) As she comes in there is a great explosion. Poussé Number One has forgotten the petrol he had poured on the piano in Act 1.

The drama is not the only art to have been revivified in France (and therefore everywhere) by Resistentialism. This remorseless modern philosophy has been reflected in the work of all the important younger composers and painters in Paris. Resistentialist music, based on acceptance of the tragic Thing-ness, and therefore limitation, of musical instruments, makes use of a new scale based on the Absolute Mathematical Reluctance of each instrument. The A.M.R. of the violin, for instance, is the critical speed beyond which it is impossible to play it because of the strings’ melting. The new scale is conceived, says Dufay, as ‘a geometric rather than a tonic progression. Each note is seen as a point on the circumference of a circle of which the centre is the A.M.R. The circle must then be conceived as inside-out’. Dufay

Dufay has expressed in mathematical terms that cosmic dissatisfaction of the artist with the physical medium in which he is forced to work. Kodak, approaching the problem from a different angle, has taken more positive steps to limit the ‘cosmic offence-power’ of the conventional scale by reducing the number of notes available. His first concerto, for solo tympanum and thirty conductors, is an extension of the argument put forward some years ago, in remarkable anticipation of Resistentialism, by Ernest Newman, music critic of the London Sunday Times, who said that the highest musical pleasure was to be derived much more from score-reading than from actual performance. Kodak is now believed to be working on a piece for conductors only.

I have left Resistentialism in painting to the end because it is over the quarrel between Ventre and Agfa, at one time his chief adherent among the artists, that the little cafes and bistros of the Quartier Latin are seething today. When Agfa first came under Ventre’s influence he accepted the latter’s detachment, not so much Franciscan as Olympic, from Things. His method was to sit for hours in front of a canvas brooding over disasters, particularly earthquakes, in which Things are hostile in the biggest and most obvious way. Sometimes he would discover that the canvas had been covered during his abstraction, sometimes not. At any rate, Agfa enjoyed a succès fou as a painter of earthquakes and recently he has shown himself impatient of the thoroughgoing néantisme (no-thingery) of Ventre, who insists relentlessly that to conform completely to the pure Resistentialist ideal a picture should not only have no paint but should be without canvas and without frame, since, as he irrefutably points out, these Things are all Things (ces choses sont toutes des choses).

The defection of Agfa and of other ‘moderates’ among the Resistentialists has been brought to a head by the formation, under a thinker named Qwertyuiop, of a neo-Resistentialist group. The enthusiasm with which medieval students brawled in the streets of Paris over the Categories of Being has lost none of its keenness today, and the recent pitched battle between Ventristes and followers of Qwertyuiop outside the Café aux Fines Herbes, by now famous as Ventre’s headquarters, has, if nothing else, demonstrated that Paris still maintains her position as the world’s intellectual centre. It is rather difficult to state the terms of the problem without using some of the Resistentialists’ phraseology, so I hope I may be pardoned for briefly introducing it.

Briefly, the issue is between Ventre, the pessimist, and Qwertyuiop, the optimist. Ventre, in elaborating on his central aphorism, les choses sont contre nous, distinguishes carefully between what he calls chose-en-soi, the Thing in itself, and chose-pour-soi, the Thing for itself. Chose-en-soi is his phrase for Things existing in their own right, sublimely and tragically independent of man. In so far as Ventre’s pregnant terminology can be related to traditional western categories, chose-en-soi stands for the Aristotelean outlook, which tends to ascribe a certain measure of reality to Things without reference to any objective Form in any mind, human or divine. There are even closer parallels with the later, medieval philosophy of Nominalism, which says, roughly that there are as many Things as we can find names for; Ventre has an interesting passage about what he calls inversion (inversion) in which he exploits to the full the contrast between the multiplicity of actions which Things can perform against us from a slightly overhanging tray falling off a table when the removal of one lump of sugar over-balances it, to the atomic bomb and the paucity of our vocabulary of names on such occasions.

The third great concept of Ventre is le néant (the No- Thing). Man is ultimately, as I have said, a No-Thing, a metaphysical monster doomed to battle, with increasing non-success, against real Things. Resistentialism, with what Ventre’s followers admire as stark, pagan courage, bids man abandon his hopeless struggle.

Into the dignified, tragic, Olympian detachment of Ventre’s ‘primitive’ Resistentialism the swarthy, flamboyant Qwertyuiop, has made a startling, meteoric irruption. Denounced scornfully by the Ventristes as a plagiarist, Qwertyuiop was, indeed, at one time a pupil of Ventre. He also asserts the hostility of Things to man – but he sees grounds for hope in the concept of chose-pour soi (the Thing for itself) with which it is at least possible to enter into relationship. But he is more a dramatist than a philosopher, and what enrages the Ventristes is the bouncing optimism of his plays and also the curious symbolic figure of the géant or giant which appears in them all. This giant is a kind of Resistentialist version of Nietzsche’s superman, a buskined, moustachioed figure who intervenes, often with great comic effect, just when the characters in the play are about to jump down a well (the well is, of course, a frequent Resistentialist symbol – cf. Ventre’s own Puits Clos).

The Ventristes point out acidly that in the first edition of Résistentialisme the word géant appears throughout as a misprint for néant. Friction between the two groups was brought to a head by Qwertyuiop’s new play Messieurs, les choses sont terribles, (loosely, Gentlemen, Things are Terrible). On the first night at the Théatre des Somnambules, the Ventristes in the gallery created an uproar and had to be expelled when, at the end of the second act, the inevitable giant had stepped in to prevent three torturings, seven betrayals, and two suicides. The battle was renewed later with brickbats and bottles when Qwertyuiop and his followers interrupted one of Ventre’s choseries, or Thing- talks, at the Café aux Fines Herbes. Five of the moderates and two Ventristes were arrested by the gendarmerie and later released on bail. All Paris is speculating on the outcome of the trial, at which many important literary figures are expected to give evidence.

It is, however, not in the law courts that the influence of Resistentialism on our time will be decided. It is in the little charcuteries and épiceries of the Left Bank. It is in the stimulating mental climate of Paris that the artists and dramatists will decide for themselves whether there is any future for art in the refined philosophical atmosphere to which Ventre’s remorseless logic would have them penetrate. Although Qwertyuiop has succeeded in attracting many of Ventre’s more lukewarm followers among the arts, who had begun to rebel against the Master’s uncompromising insistence on pictures without paint and music without instruments, without any Things at all, there seems no doubt that Ventre is the greater thinker, and it is an open question whether he will achieve his object of persuading the world to abandon Things without the indispensable help of the artistic confraternity in moulding public opinion.

There is no doubt, either, that Ventre’s thought strikes a deep chord in everyone daring these sombre, post-atomic times. Ventre has, I think, liberated the vast flood of creative hatred which makes modern civilization possible. My body, says Ventre, is chose-en-soi for me, a Thing which I cannot control, a Thing which uses me. But it is chose-pour-soi for the Other. I am thus a Hostile Thing to the Other, and so is he to me. At the same time it follows (or it does in the French) that I am a No-Thing to the world. But I cannot be united or merged with the WorldThing because my Thing-Body, or Not-Other, gives me an illicit and tragically deceptive claim on existence and ‘happiness’. I am thus tragically committed to extending the area of my always illusory control over the Thing-body – and as the ‘mind’ associated with my Thing-body is merely the storing up of recollected struggles with Things, it follows that I cannot know the Other except as one of the weapons with which the World-Thing has increased its area of hostile action.

Resistentialism thus formalizes hatred both in the cosmological and in the psychological sphere. It is becoming generally realized that the complex apparatus of our modern life – the hurried meals, the dashing for trains, the constant meeting of people who are seen only as ‘functions’: the barman, the wife, etc. – could not operate if our behaviour were truly dictated by the old, reactionary categories of human love and reason. This is where Ventre’s true greatness lies. He has transformed, indeed reversed the traditional mechanism of thought, steered it away from the old dogmatic assumption that we could use Things, and cleared the decks for the evolution of the Thing-process without futile human opposition. Ventre’s work brings us a great deal nearer to the realization of the Resistentialist goal summed up in the words, ‘Every Thing out of Control.’

<blockquote>Sanford Alexander Sr. was born a slave in South Carolina in 1823. His exact arrival in Sandtown Community in Neshoba County near the Bogue Chitto Community is not known. He was purchased at a slave market in New Orleans, Louisiana, by the Alexander family and brought to this area. Sanford was freed in 1865 in Neshoba County, Mississippi, at the age of 42. He lived 64 years as a free man in Neshoba and Kemper Counties. Sanford was the father of 10 children from two marriages, this expanded the Alexander name for over six generations.

Sanford was a successful farmer who acquired several hundred acres of land. The offspring of this former slave are productive citizens who are proud of their heritage. His grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren are successful lawyers, doctors, corporate managers, computer programmers, pilots, professional football players, cattle ranchers, insurance agents, underwriters, educators and entrepreneurs. He died in 1929 at the age of 106.

Sanford was buried in the Liberty United Methodist Church Cemetery in Collinsville, Mississippi. His grandson, the late Kutcher Threefoot Alexander, Sr., purchased a memorial headstone for his grave. Kutcher Threefoot Alexander found and preserved a portrait of our great-grandfather.

Sanford was married to Charlotte and Mandy. His children are: Mary Alexander Polluck, Mike Alexander, Frank Alexander, Daughty Alexander McClain, Miles Alexander, Lewis Alexander (father of Kutcher), Jerry Alexander, John Alexander, Maranda Alexander Donald and Mary Louise "Lou" Alexander Hall.

The b and i tags are still valid and have a measure of applicability. Please read the specification before you attempt to instruct others.

It shows a misunderstanding of the phrase "more semantic" when one says that "strong elements are more semantic than b elements." Not only is this not the case, but it makes no sense for it to be the case. The applicability of b and applicability of strong are mutually exclusive. For one, it is obvious that strong has a connotation to represent on top of the text itself where as b has no connotation beyond stylistic marking. Style is the only property they share, while their uses determine their meaning. We don't mean to only suggest, and nothing more, "this is italic text" or "this is bold text." If the task were that simply, sure, we would have redundancy in the markup, and so on. But "more semantic" suggests a measure of applicability. So surely strict observance of the specification which describes the criteria for use, and key awareness of doctype, is markedly instrumental to discussion. Worth a shot, no?

Any mention of the linguistic markings which go on in academic literature, European, American, etc will easily attest to the major role of the b and i elements' and their meaning. Think of i as having an implicit meta-data taxonomization which may describe dialectic or historical data; we think this when identifying the Latin mid-sentence. In a web design context, think of b as the most basic textual representation of a "call to action." b represents a kind of thingness on the page. One way to look at them is with fear, as a developer, due to the verb implication of b's. They don't have much to say linguistically, in terms of the content itself or otherwise, but they do shoot upwards the idea that the text itself, as a whole message, stands in a certain relation to the web page. b, then, seems to me, under the worst case scenario, like a UI hook.

Think of b as the "prompt" for inline elements.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Language is part of the human organism and is no less complicated than it." -- In language we find that expression never lacks an authority, chiefly, one for whom such expression entraps and fails to disclose. Nevertheless, authority orients meaning, the stuffness and "poignancy" therein, those words, dry as they are, the objects of reference.

But what is language, indeed? The stuff on the street, hidden behind my showering wall? I see it here before me, and littered grid-ly across my screen and driver's side view. Perchance I should avoid such broad sweeping strokes of language? -- Much of that ain't language!

And yet the Web phenotype is lost. The extension of life, persistence, technically more divine, on abouts and in expression, than any religious doctrine or psalm. No text grants the doctrine of immortality, save the storehouses of the Web phenotype.

And soon, should it become medically relevant, as study wherein an age only real-time study is credible, morally and toward one's economic sensibilities? I wish to understand the language I speak, and yet the Web is here, stifling it with immortality.

What kind of god is this? I imagine in me, this one needs for you to know my Web organism. And why shouldn't you? Or I? What have I done? -- Lacking any opinion from enframement and mechanics of browser -- the perspective of forensics. A god that will let the linguistic phenotype exceed its parameters.

And what science demands to understand.]]></content:encoded>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The result is that we don’t seek reproductive success directly; we seek tasty foods that have tended to promote survival, and luscious mates who have tended to produce bright, healthy babies. The modern result? Fast food and pornography.

</blockquote>
Some time ago I had a similar thought. It struck me after I found myself interested in autism, largely for personal reasons. Immediately it seems no less disconcerting to analytic philosophy, a tradition dogmatically rooted in a rejection of the historical mode (the dialectical passions of history). Thus, they must reject the propositions of history, but not that they are incapable of philosophical fruit, or even just assisting fostering it. Simply that it yields only anecdotal truth, something like relative truth. In any event, I've usually found it repugnant, philosophy, for this observation alone. -- It seems an artificial meekness. The peripatetics will likely find root in any genuine context for the explorative passions.

With autism, the unclear idea may become clearer, the realization of a genetic safe-guard. Christians have an artificial safe-guard, their language; a principle of engineering abstinance, and at base, it is psychological. Their terms will refer for many years to come. Peripatetics, likewise, the mental obfuscation that language allows. Use in technology is inherently not philosophically interesting. Their <em>façan de parler</em> will be in tract. And really, how long can we go on with ignoring austistic claiming, for all intents and purposes, to be (aasimar)[<a href="http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html">http://www.jonathans-stories.com/non-fiction/autism-genetics.html</a>]? Their language is above all the rest.
If information wants to be free, at what cost? At what relevant cost? Want could information feasibly and conceivably damage in terms of the human phenotype, should its rate of production excessively make erratic the structure of the human condition? How can information be an enemy to us, a survival threat?

How much semantic, architectural, economic, ideological scaffolding does one find in an interface? And how widely, systematically, and reliably are these languages deployed?

As a child I never quite understood what the interface stood for. With legos, I developed everything. I'd learn the manuals, but after recurring parades of bedroom destruction, I would rebuild in my own language. While stepping through the manuals, I never would take the time to identify complexity. Every manual produced one construction. I saved the "learning of language" for my own creativity endeavoring in the Lego system. For years I did this, and I believe such practice instilled in me a capacity to reject interfaces. Let's say, the notion of the Common (polite dinner talk, morality, religion, gods, voting, popular music, etc).

I often rarely _disagree_; but the grid is a bit off.

I’m quite sure I am even less capable now; but often "representation" becomes a topic in philosophy. The interface is a unique manifestation of actual representation. Even more abstract.
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"iP address"? That's something Steve Jobs did right?</p>
</blockquote>
The interesting part, however, is that the U.S. government, I think, is has (realized)[<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/2011/12/16/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works">http://motherboard.vice.com/2011/12/16/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works</a>] it too. A certain feature is required to address what Heidegger observes in "man":
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Man is what lies at the bottom of all beings; and that is,
in modern termsww, at the bottom of all objectification and
representability.
-- Martin Heidegger, 1940</p>
</blockquote>
Mike Judge, Steve Pemberton, and others have seen it. Soon our human phenotype must harmonize with the potential threats of alluring phenotype extension (now, as evolution would have it, between the technological mode of thought housed inside the human capability and the Semantic Web, a web which has internalized the framework development of the Analytics of the early 20th-century and the ordinary language professors, and dating back to the Latin with its prescriptive and proscriptive qualities, the basis of Cartesian thought, and on and on. The web is a systematic articulation of grammars: a complete distillation of power structure, and thus authority; the basis for understanding liberty, as they define each other -- thus, the incompatibility of the Web and Governments). In object-oriented programming we allude to problems like this by saying things like "that object is too big," namely suggesting that not only does it bear too much, but the complexity itself seems to imply only further complexity in certain undesirable ways. When interfacing with it, checking its properties, etc.

Often I hear people talking about computers, the Facebooks and Tumblrs and all, as if they're natural events in one's everyday life. But with Christians, autistics, philosophers, and certain other types, these computer events are less accidental and more intentional; Christians usually in reaction, autistics in production, philosophers in speculation (meta-production). But the common thread of humanity will simply yield, and the U.S. government hopes to manage the inevitable rupture to the status qua that the Web is now presenting. It is a human psychological-cognitive scalability issue, latent with ethical strictures and with an underpinning trajectory to preserve the common language, such that the Web's rules for communication and privacy do not uplift what the U.S. government sees as protecting, protection of "We, the people".

If the government cannot understand the objects of reference of its populace, it is no government. The Web and Government must pass over in silence.
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This, too, may be happening already. Christian and Muslim fundamentalists and anti-consumerism activists already understand exactly what the Great Temptation is, and how to avoid it. They insulate themselves from our creative-class dreamworlds and our EverQuest economics. They wait patiently for our fitness-faking narcissism to go extinct. Those practical-minded breeders will inherit the Earth as like-minded aliens may have inherited a few other planets. When they finally achieve contact, it will not be a meeting of novel-readers and game-players. It will be a meeting of dead-serious super-parents who congratulate each other on surviving not just the Bomb, but the Xbox.

Where is this in <em>our aesthetic</em>? An aesthetic wherein a culture is no greater than its effects. Rooted in belief or by product of evolutionary narration, the explanation must concern itself with present existence of culture and the meaning such a fact holds with respect to it.

The possibility of privacy secures for one the foundation for happiness; but as yet, the genuine expression of silence is incapable where <em>the aesthetic </em>exists.

I confirm those in silence for its sake, or those who genuinely depend on it for survival. We live in an economy of silence underplayed.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I very likely would. I am a fan of Heidegger.

But at the moment I’m very much concerned with whether or not I actually have Asperger’s. Not sure if “awareness” of one’s symptoms disqualifies (as that sounds asinine and "philosophical" anyway), or to what degree, but too much of this is adding up. Sometimes it’s unsettling how long I can spend thinking about one sentence someone has uttered. Or spend working on one thing, doing one thing, missing what people are saying or being misunderstood.

Even today it takes mental effort to feel comfortable with people touching me. I often have to draft a brief mental list of "who's a friend" before I go outside such that when I do run into X, I can pre-establish/prepare what I'll be comfortable with. And often that thinking follows a historical progressive path _for the person_ or set of people I'm to encounter. I think: "Well, we shook hands yesterday; now, _this_ is appropriate."

I don’t… think I like it. Lately everything has felt like overload. Sometimes I don't even want to leave the house for fear of disruption... As if every day I expect to me restructured. For a while I thought I was getting "better," but it seems more like people are just predictable (cynicism).]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That's heavy. I mean, if so, hopefully it assists in understanding and configuring your life. I dunno. I remember thinking I had ADD, possibly bi-polar. Then I was on anti-depressants but all that happened was an onslaught of breakdowns. I'm sure there's some short-circuit in my wiring. Was it time, place, a slip of seconds, a neural space? I dunno. I hate leaving the house too. So much. And more and more it's coupling itself religiously with some (may or may not) existent spiritual place. 

I dwell on words, stupid words for far too long, though I try to jettison the "philosophic" hemisphere frequently. It chokes me. I cast it off, but it returns like a mercury boomerang. And they, the words, have more dimensions than our nauseating space, which we drift through largely mute and motionless.  You gotta do, goddamn it, what you gotta do to make the many miles to wherever it is we're going. 

Mayhap we'll run into each other's proximity soon. Until then, I hope something allays the slow burn of time. Whatever weight it has, I wish the best for my few friends.]]></wp:comment_content>

The design concept is based in a problem of personal organization style: Given that one's writing style will emerge and disrupt a design over time, how does one maintain connection between types of content? -- My answer is a command-line-esque interface which listens for hypertext entries, littered over the page and strategically/thematically named.

[ The <em>next design element removal </em>should be obvious and perhaps shocking. And the vertical rhythm is spot on. -- An exploration into minimalism has its rewards, I suppose. But interesting problems are engender'd: Is a website not a program? Are links not its subroutines? Is hypertext a subset of English? Does microdata describe the program or the capacities for its use (which are infinite -- but the program is not nullified, then whence come the description?)?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I cannot remain ignorant on this question any longer. I've been having too many "it all adds up" moments. And sure, I'm twenty-six now: The question of whether I could potentially have a happy life, given the absence of normal social orientation, should be settled. In the end, it <em>might </em>be Asperger's, and this would be palatable.

What brings fear to my heart: Going deaf, losing my fingers or voice, the loss of reliable mental performance. Often I've wondered if I have a speech impediment. I have far too much personal evidence from linguistic performance, or lack thereof, alone. Some people with Asperger's are known to spend literally days reflecting on single sentences, uttered or read, or resurgent; I am known to do the same. Is this memory? Which compartment?

But what seems definitive is my upbringing. I believe it raises the interesting question of whether or not <em>the Spectrum </em>can be <em>engineered </em>in a person. -- I am by no means a highly intelligent person. Trust me, I've been there, through most of it. (Need I remind you that <em>social intelligence</em> is indeed a real thing? Without being "accusative"?) However, as a child, young teen (7 through 13-14), I had many, many imaginary friends. Some I keep with me, safe; the rest: hundreds of names lost.

Often when you approach pomo-men or sentimentalist types, they will join in with you in a usually punctuated discourse on the finer points of Lego. Typically the discussion ends off at how much one had, and rarely, the discussion will touch on the educative-instructive qualitive of the Lego concept. Most males simply want to prove that they identify with something <em>cute</em>; others that they are so mature in their logical acumen, <em>lego </em>is a nostalgic experience (but now "<em>I'm practical in that I can given up a kind of ivory tower behavior."</em>)

I recall quite vividly, daily, chasing down people to show them something I've built. Weekends were often dedicated to sharing Lego concept ideas with friends. I ended friendships on account of lack of <em>creativity. </em>Yes, Hitlerian perhaps, but I was maybe 9. What's interesting is that <em>someone 9 years of age believed himself to be a critique of something. </em>In this case, I s'pose, it was the arrangement of blocks, to put it in a philosopher's terms. In a sense, their import and significance is wildly low, but there I was, casting friends aside in the silence of my room until the next <code>lego push -u origin shelf</code>.

When people mention Legos, that feeling recurs. At every mention. I suddenly <em>lose </em>the concern with being touched by strangers, my sarcasm radar gets kick'd, and I'm grabbing hands to dash off to some room in an old apartment that I haven't seen in a decade's time. I remember a room policy. There was a <em>building time. </em>How strange, that I allotted this for myself.

Engineering Asperger's seems like a pointless effort. Some aspies consider themselves <em>higher forms</em> of life. So many heads, so many opinions. But one effect (which may have fallen out of this litter of wordsoup) is the activation of certain forms of highly accurate, emotionally dense memory modalities through the capacities of those affected by echolalia. Like I said, not smart; and whether the content is true or not, a major preoccupation of my mind's activity it seems is the relocation of autohistorical events through the exercise of known physical-linguistic capacities. Often times I will depend on and exploit language in ways that resembles <em>religious practice</em>, so as to <em>get through a thought. </em>But <em>what counts as language? </em>

I cannot withstand these thought any longer for the moment. Somewhat overwhelming, but to put it briefly: <em>Asperger's explains too much to be totally unjustifiable </em>or <em>irrelevant. </em>(And the great thing is, neurotypicals usually don't want to talk about how you may be of the ranks of Einstein or whoever the fuck. Or then there's the whole Rain Man neurosis that is now pervasive; like I said, sentimentalism, etc. -- The point is, if you want to fucking talk about Legos, don't fucking bring your bench team memories.)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>For discussion with testers.</em> Applies to the "meta-views" for all Web projects. So, a "view" would correspond to a use-case. Developers product templates which are the physical components of the Web project. A "meta-view" concerns the "environment" wherein the view is perceived by the user. That is to say, what structures and defines content solely in virtue of the constraints and limitations of the environment.

The physical templates combined with the data models (as used physical "data tags," (like {{ someObject.someProperty }}); since the HTML idiom is our base) produce views. The controller does all the magic, etc. The "view" has at least one sense: the use-case, but the use-case is defined irrespective from the "meta-views" or physical aspects of the Web project. A tester analyses and reports the physical limitations of the Web project (the code arrangement and the limits of arrangement). The types of code arrangement, I believe, roughly conform to the concept list in the mnemonic.

Accessibility concerns human readers while SEO non-human consumers/navigators/agents/etc. The idea here is that a baseline set of front-end problems exists for each "meta-view" (I prefer to call them "front-end aspects" or just "aspects".) "Desktop" is where a majority of the focus has been historically. "Edit Mode" concerns tests involving, traditionally, "back-end" or "administrative" front-ends.
<h2>A demo</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A, <em>Accessibility</em></li>
	<li>D, <em>Desktop</em></li>
	<li>E, <em>Edit</em> Mode</li>
	<li>M, <em>Mobile</em></li>
	<li>O, Search Engine <em>Optimization</em></li>
</ul>
Ideally, then, a successful Web project's issue tracking system should entail at least 5 narratives about these "aspects" (environments of possible user experience).

So, let's prepare for a demo!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>&#10077; Through the website, radio, phone calls, things like that, we raised about $1.5 million in nine months.
— University of Alberta DCA Research Center, Michelakis.</blockquote>
Query: Could $1.5 million fund a U.S.-specific deployment to administer this cure?
<blockquote>&#10077; Scientists cure cancer, but no one takes notice

Canadian researchers find a simple cure for cancer, but major pharmaceutical companies are not interested.

Researchers at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Canada have cured cancer last week, yet there is a little ripple in the news or in TV. It is a simple technique using very basic drug.The method employs dichloroacetate, which is currently used to treat metabolic disorders. So, there is no concern of side effects or about their long term effects.</blockquote>
Boring. What's going on with this planet?

[<strong>EDIT, Jan.1.2012</strong>: Turns out there's a lot of debate on the safety of DCA, but people still have hope for it. And are generally concerned with the lack of information on its progress. @see <a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-latest-chapter-in-the-seemingly-never-ending-saga-of-dichloroacetate-as-a-cancer-treatment/">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-latest-chapter-in-the-seemingly-never-ending-saga-of-dichloroacetate-as-a-cancer-treatment/</a>]]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So here's the deal. I'm wagering that you will never actually receive this message. I'm not a hacker, but what seems to be clear is that now, knowing basic *nix programs mv, echo, ssh, apt-get, their syntactical combinations, etc., configuring routers, proxying, rebuilding parts of the damaged Web, will become necessary to maintain a level of human dignity established by our creation, the Internet. A principled exploration into Babylon. Safe, assured, backwards-compatible.

But this world introduces an economic class bifurcation too basic for the categories of proletarian and bourgeoisie. Low-to-middle-to-high-class spectrum rubbish. The Internet has self-sustaining complexity... Somehow.

(For those tl; dnr: basically, Congress doesn't know how to politik this kind of innovation, I feel. It's showing in the cracks of the media industry: #sopa, #protect-ip, #nick-bostrom, #google-will-relocate-to-europe, #microsoft-will-relocate-to-canada, #microsoft-will-begin-research-on-curing-the-aging-process, #chi_b-(3P), #spinoza's-ethics-and-its-warnings-on-religious-knowledge, #noninformation-on-earth-shattering-cures-for-evolutionary-villains-and-drawbacks-to-being-human, #etc.

It's the fact that you're reading this on whatever device, wherever it is that you are _right now_. Last week, some British kid kickstarted a millionaire-career after dabbling with a research web app as a side-note to his school homework. In the screen shot. Imagine something of that complexity -- just imagine mere complexity -- being handed around in grocery stores. It's not that Web development is gold. Or that the market's good now for the tech sector. In commoditization of data, we see a strange kind of science fiction. The U.S. needs to manage complexity. It's a fear-monger. It's like handing a (mechanalogue)[http://www.flickr.com/photos/wittysense/4776779403/in/photostream] to a primitive human. It's that I can make up any language I wish and have it bring about real change in the world. Why? Congress views every click of a link as a potential transgression of law; and they need the infrastructure to prove it.)

In a sense, it has become clear to me that two worlds now exist. Marxists could not have predicted when the proletariat would need to secure its own poverty of the imagination. Democracy is just a category for Marxist theory, anyway. It's not a theory, it's an experiment that must be studied. The complexity of the Internet has rendered knowledge to the problem: Assuming that can understanding is possible, what real good does knowledge bring?

I have discovered for myself that the world in fact does not want the Internet. Information must travel at a rate subject to human limitation.

Why produce such a thing? That must grow in ways unimaginable?

The Internet tells me there is a cure for cancer. That Congress -- the simple facts of what it is that they're talking about. That the topic is <em>this</em>, namely the regulations of #sopa or the #protect-ip. It tells me Canadians are confirming vaccinations for AIDS/HIV. Canada is just North. We've recently discovered Chi_b (3P). Like hackers will care. Like China could mobilize. I think we've hit a peak. Some say the Internet will route damage. But #sopa is the product of people fooling people. We mismanaged ourselves, and now Congress has simply become cannibalistic. This country has become cannibalistic. It's happening in glimmers now on your fax news station, or in your Times.

And no one cares. (But that will change once other countries realize the U.S. is a #failed-project.)

It's clear that this country is not ready for something like the Internet. What is #sopa?

It's a #fucking-innovation-eviction-notice.

---

Notice the dragged-and-dropped screenshot. Notice everything going on there. That's happening most likely on some rinky dink Moore's Law lovin' toaster. Your Macbook, your solaris rendering machine, your Windows vomit-garage. All the same, that shit is going on by virtue of commodity software. That science fiction. That obfuscated language of nerdy loverboys. That philosophical tone of matured technical mastery, almost sorceress-like. The DOM trees and representationalism gone mad with sophistication...

Why is #sopa and all this strangeness of media fog of war going on? Well, I've always scoffed at those who raise the question, "Well, you're better off than most, no? -- We're in America for crying out loud!"

Interesting. My only response would be, and has been, in convenience store scenarios: "Have you seriously stopped to reflect on the philosophical tenets of your outburst?" My most well informed friends will be talking about cancer months from now. And then they'll realize.

The U.S. government and its political schematization of power was ready for coffee and oil as commodity. It's laughable ready for energy. And this is why Chi_b and the higgs boson research largely go unnoticed. This country and its humble religious background and cultural bootstrapping can handle the widespread deployment of simple-minded tools. But technology has adopted its candidate for first commodity: Information.

And Congress has a response: "WHAT THE FUCK? SLOW THE FUCK DOWN."

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[1. Rate limited by human faculty of accessing and performing operations with data. Biologically limited system. Not sold on it being a necessary, hard, or inviolable limit. Indifferent to the facticity of "hard AI". 

2. Sold on the dark age bit. Peppered with a bit of enlightenment era hubris, sufficiently advanced technologically opulent society will endure shifting norms, as bio-hedonism becomes the mark of virtue. 

3. Good point raised with the importance of knowledge. Should knowledge bring improvement? I think the tragic state of things (Prometheus, the tree of knowledge, the Iron Age) was apprehended time ago. Hell, even philosophic anamnesis suggests it. Not everyone handles knowledge (or information) in the same manner. See last clause of 2. What do we mean when we speak of the initiate? Arbitrary power structure or prudence? Even if arbitrary, then all arbitrary and so why not, where does civility gain its thrust? Even if relativism, or no "legitimate" moral ground, that doesn't imply a defense of enlightenment ethics (which was already ethics corroded quite a bit).

4. I see the explosion of the microchip and then its trickle down into other markets, introduction of the pc, the cell phone, the internet: a general shift of the market value of information--- as fairly responsible for boom in world population. Floated on credit, which got its "lasting appeal" in the computer age, and now credit to absurdity. That's obviously coming down. But so have (and for a longer time) advancements in microchips, as they've been "regulated" on the market via entertainment feedback on the part of consumers. That was what really spurred the explosion of the home pc and the internet (which became widespread in homes even faster than the pc). Personal control of content, and sufficiently stimulating content. Combined with the physical limitations of 2dimensional chips. Plateau. The new markets had been established. Microchips in cars, microchips in blenders. It's the norm. Boom is bust. Excess cash flowing around, excess going to entertainment, parts made in third world countries, excess going to humanitarian organizations, more unendemic food sources. Population up. No boom seen of that magnitude. Next boom, if it can be reached, will be a continuation of the refinement of information. But how to make that narcotic appealing to consumers? Control of 3d spaces. Holographs, biotech, nanotech. (Not to mention the humanitarian benefits medical science will accrue.) Government will limit like a dying madman. 

I'm not sold on it not limiting. I think that urge comes from that last clause of 2. Maybe Nietzsche called that nihilism, I have no fucking clue. 

Should life be about living, or waiting? That seems to be the final question of technology.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The total collection and chronological arrangement of one's actual and potential IP address states defines one's <em>spirit</em>.

The engagement of a link so as to follow it is an <em>action.</em> One may, naturally, follow a link blindly or wittingly. One may be destroyed or rewarded.

The U.S. government has made it clear that the following of a link, a particular form of engagement, is politically interesting. The proliferation of links, a problem for education, and insofar as link debt. We may also consider a language for describing the roaming, formation, flocking, hiberation and so on, of links.

As we believe that the Web breathes, that the Web's complexity is self-sustaining: that the Web and the Internet are not one -- that we can imagine the Web without the Internet, and without the physical limitation its superstructure brings -- it should become clear that the basic currency of the Web (as a sui generis economic system incompatible with democratic installations) and the following of a link must be made known. That is, in light of the unexpected intrusion of the earthshakers into the Web's ethical and philosophical space.

You can see this interpretation now. Recent legislation is considered <em>damage</em> or something like a virus. In the Web, things like #sopa don't <em>live long enough to become a political concept.</em>]]></content:encoded>

Developer #1: Have you ever seriously wondered, how does one actually piss off a programmer?
Developer #2: What, at a dinner party or in a polite family reunion? 
Developer #1: Assume you're a cocky marry-in. Well, you ask that person to recant their GPL licenses. You ask all of them to do this. You ask them to take the document their hero, Stallman, the guy they don't talk about much, the document he drafted. Which they accepted into their hearts. And well, now they just don't talk about him much anymore.
Developer #2: You ask them to dig that guy up. And delete him from their repositories!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<code>We're authors too. We call our leaders "benevolent dictators for life". Things like that. We aren't governments building sites. We're people who stay up and toil for something most people never see. I'm usually expected to defer or effect a continued veil over my work, but in light of the direct, expressed assault on it by the United States: I'll say something.</code>

<code>The Internet is a marketplace that people have been experimenting with for the past 20 years. That DARPA stuff isn't it. The Web browser was our gateway drug. Imagine the whacky hobbyist who collects pigeon beaks to produce a sculpture so immense, complex and pointless. When people do this in concert, the idea emerges that the complexity of doing so in such fashion produces other structures. My friends, we are drafting programming languages so to assert our eternity in the light of the coming accelerated mass production of the computer system. We cannot stop it. And we're not really doing "it," are we?</code>

<code>The Internet is a twilight graveyard (alluding to the place dragons go when they die in the DND universe; these are the kinds of narratives, truths, that we have allowed to harmoniously merge into our marketsquares; pixies, porn and art deco chairs). Hoarders, collectors, OCD people and this ilk have built a system for communication whose only material assumption is the existence of the number system. The Internet needs IP addresses, not computers. This is why we are building commercial quantum computation systems NOW. Imagine if you could put the DNS system ANYWHERE and claim that it without proper Observation statements, it exists nowhere? All we need is the number theory. The fact that the Internet is on a planet now is a fact of nature. With these laws and these terminals owned by the same markets that import cheese and porn. On this planet the only poignant metaphor that works is that the DNS is a phone book. The Internet a marketplace. The Web is its newspaper. Hyperlinks are the basic currency. Money is a transitional phase to us. Our licenses that protect our ideas, between ourselves, where we've hoarded and brewed since the first implementation of the Internet, do not understand "money". You have to understand that these documents exist. The Internet, in the Marxist-Capitalist idiom or narrative is an implementation of anarchy. My friend, Congress just asked that question. You're asking me and my peers what we've been up to? While I entertain your views on money, the cynicism, the moderate views, others with extreme views, etc, I've been building the Internet On Your Soil. And it does Not need money. Our licensing system IS our Dispute Resolution Guideline, and we all know it by heart. The Internet is monolithic anarchy.</code>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.</blockquote>
I would like to describe for you, what I consider to be the beginning of an epoch: the convergence of worlds. Where I become a micro science fiction publisher, or you confess to the coming of an end. Sincerely, with salivation and grievances.

Please pardon that I should be so cliche, in choosing Nietzsche. It simply dawn'd on me, the acute sting of anxiety in one's vacillating mind. Some days it ceases, but today, we might call it a quaint emancipation. Whatever it is, what remains clear is that should it happen at all is the same kind of question as why any of it should be.

<em>Dear brothers and sisters, Enemies and Friends, </em>we have set our hearts to build the <em>Tower of Babel</em>.

There is something we all have in common, and that is which is not. The stone, the brick, a whistle, a rub. These things are, and quite so they cannot not. It's quite simple.

You see, the hyperlink is not. What indeed does it contain? My philosophers, I ask you: What if it contains nothing? A supreme ethicist might reply: "Well, indeed! One's politics should be highly subject to fear should it become interesting to the fewer of the greater!" -- "What if they truly are saying nothing?"

You see it on television shows, film noirs, police dra-mas. The moment of dead silence. This is what the world has come to, for <em>we are applied at the thought.</em>

One might say, <em>that in a definitive sense </em>we have solved the mind-body problem. A hyperlink consists of two parts, part stone and part spirit. We may traverse the history of stone, and the history of heaven: the heaven unto we shall build.

On earth, we have accomplish'd a number of things. We have come near to the thought of <em>deep exploration</em>. Miraculous science and art, but yet as like with old, it is our selves which has consumed us. Our names shall be scattered across the earth.

What I say to you is this. When you share a hyperlink, you say two things, what is commonly called a tag's "hypertext" <em>and </em>what is called the "hyperlink." The distinct is <em>deadly serious</em>, as it were.

If your government wants to know what you've <em>shared </em>it shall coincidentally know <em>what you say. </em>And <em>whereof one cannot speak </em>thereof <em>one must pass over in silence.</em>

Legislated surveillance.

How many of your links do you <em>believe</em> look like the following?
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>... &lt;a href="#"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://mypersonalsite.com"&gt;personal site, &lt;/a&gt; ...</code></p>
<em>Careful how you link<a href="http://sopaopera.org/">.</a></em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my mind, it makes perfect sense.

Google et al. are right. We _are_ "innovating" faster and smarter than all other industries. But what is innovation? The new colonialism? Or did the Capitalists fully harmonize away "the error" in Marx's critique?

Innovation _on_ U.S. soil _in_ a place claimed to have no soil, The Internet. We are, in a sense, leeches. And we know it. We don't care about your television, your baseball games, you designer shoes, your mortgages, confessions; we _can_ care these things. And we can turn it off.

We. Don't. Need. The. Internet.

But you do. Microsoft is mass producing the television-computer. It was an easy, easy transition for you. You moved from the radio, to the soaps, to the reality television, until finally, you. became. the. reality. No, you cannot stop flicking the channel. You cannot stop sharing the hyperlink.

In 30 seconds, I can have a personal copy of the Internet downloaded to my personal 2TB drive. There are a lot of numbers going on here. I, for the most part, understand the proportions. I can personally say how much of the Internet I want. But can you? Will you be able to find others who have done the same? And rebuild?

In my mind, the Internet is a public experiment. Who will acquiesce? Who will learn the most? Who will use our tools? These are the terms our government thinks in. When the market is producing business execs who systematically fail to under terms like "AJAX," terms we've understood for  years, and when we start to build more APIs than consumers can digest, that's when the government realizes a utilitarian premise. An abominable one. <em>The programmers are being under utilized. </em>And sites like "clientsfromhell dot com" exist, where <em>we </em>only deride <em>you </em>and sometimes unfairly. But it is a good rule of thumb, right? "Clients are stupid." Will the programmers be avoided such benefit of the doubt when the brick and mortar business come rolling back with vengeance? Doubtful. Most of the time, my clients become visibly discontent when I try to explain my processes to them, processes that involve the delicate handling of and close analysis of their <em>content. </em>And they argue with me that I should respect Internet Explorer users as "good business sense." Their clients, stupid. My client, "stupid." Everybody, "stupid."

They're not really watching the other industries. "Innovation" has been defined too narrowly. They've only been watching the technologists.

They're going to take back the Internet because you people stole it from them. With your "demand."

It makes perfect sense, "Ugh. Why do I have to compete with 14 year olds in Malaysia?"

What client is more put together than the United States? No, no, I mean, surely they can put together an RFP that would tickle the mind of any programmer.

Under laws like #sopa, programmers who take on non-governmental projects subject themselves to absolute liability: Protect your client from the U.S. government, or [simply] be allowed to continue to innovate by government ideology.

How many of your friends choose "chaotic evil"?

The Internet is a market, and you do not own it any longer<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account">.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What I see before me is a screen, filled with information. Why?
Does it enrich my life? Does it bring about desirable ends?

Now <em>streams</em> of content flood our screens. We permit this.
Unlike a newspaper, static and clear, we have built interfaces
To madness, clutter and debris -- this device presents information
Without opinion, or direction, or standard; without bounds

We believe ourselves to be expressing openly into the machine;
Undertaking eternity and all; but indeed into the machine

Untrained to unlearn the machine,
Some feed, become derelict, some ignore,
Yet render unto the machine]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I call it the _Tower of Babel_. This must be what it looked like then. Our politics have reached a convergence with the limits of imagination. And now we must scatter.

"General-purpose network" will become a definition for terms we use to identify actual communities.

Things like 1337speak need new gods. "Filesharing as a religion" is an indicator. Perhaps the powers that be see a problematic in effects of information density?

What are the casualties of this new kind of war, the cyberwar? What are their affects on the general-purpose media network?

What are our causalities now? The U.S. government wants us to understand something, and I'm not quite sure what it is. But I feel they are telling me that I haven't been safe from what they are trying to take control of. As an American citizen, one must face, it seems, an issue of trust. _Who_ is prepared to talk in terms of war when the traditional weapons bring no weight? When ssh is a rifle?

What are the causalities in this kind of war?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[(<em>Rubbish. I hate tainting my things in this way.</em>)

All right, fine, Politico et al (even after you put me through that invasive sign-up process, you manage to overlook subtly):

How does this story actually affect us? You're telling us we should be prepared for a fact-based introspection into Obama's social justice spirit. We haven't seen it, but apparently it's there.

How will this change the stage of NDAA? SOPA? PIPA? GMOs? Our debt? Our ongoing wars (most notably the cyberwar that nobody truly understands the casualties of)? Media blackouts? War on half-baked metaphors? The bloody STINK of capitalist bravado in the Streets? Shoving around dissenters? Veterans telling me to get a gun, in Texas.

People need to be seeing these questions. Because the substance of Obamas failure will be their answers.

Let's see your story. Everyone is saying it irrational to believe it's "just Obama," and then you release _this_. You're telling us some confluence of some kind of raw humanity or passion between them will ultimately determine our benefit. Let's see it.

Give us paternalism. Give us your Grand Theory.

I want to here this narrative.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I really do not understand why any of this has grown to such maturity (#ndaa, #pipa, the fact that Comcast cannot comply with a DNS redirect policy, but somehow its medialawyerXPs, at NBC Universal, simply don't talk to the nerds; and now our president apparently has to re-find the backbone of marriage so that we can see his platform get a genuine shot; more American bullshit; now I have a practical threat of media blackouts, I'm looking at casualties of war apparently) manage to wage a full on war with every other industry. It's absolutely mind-blowing. This country looks, on its face, painfully and tragically mismanaged. It's cannibalistic. The drifting, rotting husk of a accidental suicide victim. I can hardly stomach it sometimes. My government is threatening me directly, dismissing plain English explanations of Google, while insinuating that Google feigns god-like morality. Not one person is prepared to stop feeling offended and simply write. Feeling offended is easier, and there's always something better one could be caught in. But now when even you cannot genuinely understand how Google is doing what it's doing, and it directly affects your life, perhaps even the basis of your reality (your gateway drug into the Internet), and it could all flip, like a switch? Recall, Google did this to China. And the fact that I say "recall" isn't some mechanism to instill anxiety or insult. It's just a damn voice. What happened to that? Why can't people just have a voice? Talk? Share? Why must compassion and emotion fall out because we're communicating through some third-party? They're your words, and they're a liability to the party, sure, but they're still <em>yours. </em>They're <em>your links. </em>

And people are telling me to see a shrink. Really? Because I'm highly opinionated? Polemical in style? Are you kidding me? I openly admit to my lack of intelligence, my slowness, my philosophy degree, my flaws and fears. It's not my fault you keep putting modesty in my mouth. I'm not modest. I'm the same person who shouted at so-and-so down the street about hacker ethics. I'm the person who quotes Voltaire and his views on assassination. I call people "motherfuckers!" And engage in reckless, bicycle behavior. HL Mencken, Nietzsche, Žižek are our posterchildren. 1984 our bedtime stories. Hitler's now a meme to promote positive messages. You know all of this. I don't know what to do with you if you're nice going to face reality with me.

And me with my biting tongue? I'll say it because it comes to me. I'm an asshole, here's a <a href="http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/a-daily-experience-of-a-google-user.png">link</a>. (Now just add 5,000 users.) Yeah, that isn't going away.]]></content:encoded>

# *nix
<ol>
	<li>Debian/Ubuntu, nano/gedit/vi. (I don't really mess around with other distros now. I install things CentOS systems from time-to-time, since that's my host's flavor. But right: <em>vi</em>.)</li>

# Windows

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["I don't need the Internet." -- It's true. Most people could get by on their phones. We've emancipated them enough to understand how to leech, like we sometimes do. And we're telling them there's a cyberwar. Just another war. A country decayed from the dogmatic conviction to foregone wars on opaque metaphors. Now we're telling people to protect themselves lest we become their daily tech support -- "What's that IP address again?"

"iP, that's something Steve Jobs did, right?"

The perception of the industries closely affiliated or indeed dependent on the Internet will change. And no one is emotionally or economically prepared. Rather, they are terrified.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a hyperlink:

&#10094;a&#10095;Hey. Hi. Hello.&#10094;/a&#10095;

It's got two parts: hyperlink and hypertext. We've become used to the idea that the world is unified in some way: reality is thus, and so private life is thus. That is the way it has always been. If it were not this way, I doubt I would be able to understand any of it for very long. Reality: By its very notion there is a degree of it presented, regardless of what anyone may call it. "The subconscious", "one's mental life"; from a certain perspective, all is merged into the fuzzy picture often recognized: <em>this </em>is Reality.

But indeed: <em>the hyperlink is in fact two</em>. What is more, <em>the hyperlink is not</em>.

We have built our lives around the assumption that the hyperlink is one. We have shared links, and given ourselves unto complexity. Now, two worlds exist: the world of links and the world of our rhetoric around those links. And then again, there is one's human organism. Imagine: Every word you share makes a connection. Imagine the language of your links.

It's the new hand grenade. You can @style it up or @rel it to the rest of the bunker. You can give it secret @titles to speak to those just enough observant, or make it speak a different @lang. It's @href is a bit like magic. And wizards have been discovering wonderful things with it, on the #, on the http, in mailto:, even apps depend on it since they depend on the #. And links come of very many @types.

The link is a tool. A tool that can be abused, limited by human bondage.

<em>Information wants to be Free. Whence comes the Link?</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sure, Liz Lemon is my hero, too, but that's because she's funny. (Though she's a <em>woman </em>through a lens: the lens of the comedic tradition. It's a support system. A community. Historically indebted, etc.)

<em>This</em>: <a href="https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/the-problem-with-women-is-too-much-self-esteem/">https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2010/09/13/the-problem-with-women-is-too-much-self-esteem/</a> and many articles <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2011/11/22/social-media-and-female-self-esteem/">like</a> <a href="http://www.kernelmag.com/features/aunt-daphne/1268/get-over-yourselves-girls/">it</a> are expressing something close to a few of my own observations.
<blockquote>"What kind of woman do you get when you combine a cultural apparatus designed to maximally extol the virtues of womanhood and cast all fault for any female shortcomings on male bias and discrimination with a biologically innate evolutionary imperative that renders men more expendable than women? Answer:

A woman with a big fat head."</blockquote>
And then there's the "analytic philosophy" bashing crowd. I have no idea why this has become a thing. But I've met too many alt-grrls (and oddly enough hyper-christian women) who get their jollies on bashing "analytic philosophy" through some short-sighted, cursory reading of, say, logical positivism. Or Continentals "get" femininity. They ultimately end up bashing straw-men but the result is a sophomore philosopher's dreams somehow forced and re-framed into the rampant pointlessness of gendered-thought such that <em>his </em>chances at scoring become a category mistake.

I recall once sitting through a impromptu, 20-30 minute conversation, lord help me, where after <em>confessing</em> that I studied philosophy at an analytic school, with a Woody Allen-esque self-deprecating joke, my female counterpart managed to wrangle the entire conversation into sweeps and sweeps of generalizations about the bankruptcy of "analytic" thought. However, every point was tinged with: "Well, why are <em>guys this way</em>?" <em>Most</em> (bias!) left-leaning women seem to be shouting up front: <em>this Analytic philosophy is a boy's club! </em>And then the theory begins on why this is the case. It certainly is true, statistically, but no one <em>made</em> it that way<em>. </em>All that realist hubris (especially my own) aside, the point is: How has it come about that systems-thinking, translation homework, "logical thinking" (<em>as dictated by an academic textbook on logic -- </em>maybe I should've used "rational?"), and all that are <em>vices? </em>Now one <em>must </em>avoid philosophy on pain of automatically positioning oneself as antagonistic to a wealth of feminist topics, for one, that one isn't even initiated on. We <em>have </em>to start with Plato. We <em>have </em>to start with Anaximander, Thales, the Sages, whatever Nietzsche said, etc. <em>We have to start somewhere.</em> It cannot <em>all </em>be male-infused wankery. This kind of skepticism is <em>too big </em>to be palatable.

<em>Ladies, the Logos ain't out to get you.</em>

Coincidentally, analytic philosophers are the arbiters of the "analytic" here in the West, and so the entire skit seemed as if an opportunity to explore the many ways in which one could cockblock a budding upstart in philosophy. Sure, some of it was personal for her part, perhaps: but <em>why? </em>I have a handful of experiences like this. And it's most undesirable to have to explain, "Oh yes. I studied analytic philosophy, and yes I do think <em>religious studies</em>, <em>cultural anthropology, gender analysis, </em>social justice, etc., etc., .etc are viable research categories." -- "Oh, sorry. I used the word 'categories' -- sue me?"

Political correctness has gone ape. <em>Cannibalistic ape.</em>

It's unclear to me how being fascinated with symbol pushing MUST entail that one buys the whole "logos-patriarchy" stuff. Thus logicians become meek and lovers of silence, while the riotgrrl/pomo/post-mod/etc femme fatales attack them for implicitly inseminating their symbols with patriarchal semantics.

Of course, it isn't surprising. Look at the playboyism of existentialism, the flurry and fray of dadaism and the Beats. And a mess of non-academic lines of thought, blended with the enemy. Now it is fashionable to despise the most mystic of mystics on account that, well, something stuff-white-people-like might say, or an A Softer World one-liner.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm glad there's a phrase for it. It should be obvious. I've personally been in a political lag. I blame Texas, but I don't have to. Now, of course, I feel a low-grade, persistent burning in my heart. It's been there since I woke this morning, and I went to sleep with it. I suppose it is the expression of pain, "Fuck you!" (<em>Not </em>fuck this.)

What sparked this is an innocent question of "Well, are you going to vote?" Indeed? Moroccans (3) are burning themselves alive in protest to unemployment. <em>America is everywhere. </em>So again, <em>fuck you. </em>I've just learned that Jobs was outsourcing slave labor in China to produce a fucking iPad I just purchased unwittingly. I've seen enumerable patrons of this product. No wonder they've declared war. Apple just noted its quarterly. They apparently have $100bn cash-in-hand. Their profits put Google's revenue to shame. Not one person is aware of the numerous potential cures for cancer since, well, what people in the upper-crusts of society <em>know </em>is that one simply doesn't "cure cancer." Now I'm aware of four techniques/drugs that <em>remember </em>what cancer looks like and <em>enhances </em>the body, in a way, with an artificially supported immune system. There are like 4 of these techniques now. Some of them are in drug trials. Imagine if they had more funding and the news <em>actually reported the research coming University of Alberta </em>or the <em>hospital trials </em>in Buffalo, NY. Our current president signed the <em>National Defense Authorization Act (#ndaa)</em>, and people look at me as if I'm trying to express my wit and intellect to vocalize a clever acronym. They feel I'm trying to <em>best</em> them, usually. <em>Competitive fucking Americans. </em>Or like I'm speaking a different language. "O hay the guy with dreadlocks is telling me I haven't been politically aware enuff." <em>Fuck you. </em>Of course, people should be in <em>absolute terror</em>. <em>But no. </em>In October, some asshole introduced the Enemy Expatriation Act. It's brief. The idea is to establish guidelines for depriving U.S. denizens of their nationality. Of course, it's just a bunch of jargon for regular people. Then there's SOPA/PIPA/ACTA. My school's newspaper published an article a day after a massive 10,000 website-strong protest (100,000 if you count social justice nods, or simply posts) which didn't even mention the other two, after SOPA. For whatever reason, people still think <em>news </em>under the traditional format, counts. I cannot wait to slap a newspaper out of some poor twit's grip. Most of this town ain't even aware that OPEN Act was passed, what, a few days ago? And the European Union is going to vote on ACTA today (or so we're told).

And here I am, all this tragic news, and Americans want to know: <em>Who will save us </em>this <em>time? </em>Jumping from one hero to the next, one political bed to the next.

The question was innocent because the person didn't know me very well. Fine. But really? Now <em>Romney </em>is the hot ticket. <em>Fuck you.</em>

But here's the kicker. I'm an anarchist. I've been an anarchist for as long as I remember. I flirted with some queer combination of Marxism, but that is <em>because </em>this country is an installation of <em>capitalism. </em>Marxism is <em>the critique of capitalism. </em>I become "Marxist" so long as I become unsettled by tragic outcomes uniquely the result of capitalism. But now, of course, capitalism <em>is not </em>the issue. This country is <em>fascist. </em>

Look, I've <em>never </em>voted. I realized Bush would win while I was in an arcade, as countless of my "level-headed" friends rambled on about their disdains, while supporting <em>themselves</em> with justifications for why the world <em>must </em>be the way it is.<em> It's bullshit. </em>Americans, for the most part, are <em>bullshitters</em>. I've seen enough pragmatism to know now that my dogmatic, hostile, bigotry will serve me well. I am not an American. Even technically speaking, I am not an American. You <em>actually </em>cannot convince <em>me, </em>a person of African-descent of this. I am <em>diaspora. </em>I do not have the "problem" of: "But you're surrendering your values!" I am <em>not </em>an American. <em>This </em>country is only nearly 9 times older than I am. And now its president <em>strikes fear </em>without merit or warrant into countless peoples' lives.

<em></em>And your bullshit country is barely over 200 years old. Who the fuck are <em>you</em>? <em>Your </em>fucking motto is "In God We Trust." <em>Fuck you. Your country is <em>trash. </em></em>I knew this from the outset, and it's easy to convince jaded Americans that you're on their side. They just want the personal affectations. Confirmation of self-worth, and all that narcissistic bullshit. And sex. Copious quantities of fucking sex. Now I'm to believe I have neuroses when in truth, I'm just a fucking overly empathetic, impressionable person who got toss into the cesspool of American consumerism, greed and mismanagement of everything within arm's reach. Who's to blame? <em>Fuck you.</em> Don't tell me I'm a fucking American. <em>Your </em>country is trash. Hell, <em>trash </em>is more relevant than this <em>bloatocracy</em>. (Back in 2007, I had similar <a href="http://webjournal.nerdfiles.net/2007/08/04/the-fourth-of-july-dans-aout/">anxieties</a>, tritely expressed.)

<em>I do not vote. </em>And fuck <em>you </em>if you think I'm some public intellectual who <em>knows better. </em>Go read and article before you approach me with your fashionable liberal politics.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When your site goes up, I will not be putting my name, or company, or a colophon that identifies myself. Moreover, please do not inform others of who developed it. I am not "open for business," as it were.

In a sense, consider yourself my <em>last public client</em>. I'm fairly confident maintaining your site will be personally manageable for both your part and my part, since it is running on Wordpress which is a beautifully orchestrated content management system.

I would prefer to continue to ensure that it runs efficiently <em>as the product I've handed off to you. </em>This, of course, does not entail novel or "interesting" new development. In another sense, <em><strong>you</strong></em> are not my client, the <strong>site </strong>is. I do not believe what I'm saying here opens a channel for communication between <strong>us </strong>about "maintenance" in the usual sense of the word. By "maintenance" I mean simply what I define as maintenance: that the site actually is running, it runs optimally, has proper database backups, and doesn't subject you to undue liability (considering the recent events of NDAA, SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, and the OPEN Act).

If you haven't been following these bits of legislation, that doesn't really matter. And it is not my job to educate you on them. But one thing you must understand is that the U.S. government has made <em>the ownership and development of a website </em>a severe liability to <em>citizens and non-citizens </em>alike. So, in truth, as your name is on the Registrar ticket, you need to properly educate yourself on the guidelines and recent developments of ICANN and the European Union's ACTA guideline (which seems to contain by some interpretations <em>potentially binding laws</em>). Of course, it is a trade agreement, not law. Very soon the concept of a TLD (top level domain; .com, .org., .net) will change radically, and possibly such that it will be an exorbitant cost to continue to own a TLD. (This is why domains like .xxx and .info and so on are cropping up. Imagine that ".com" is <em>for Fox news and company </em>while ".info" is for your local community kiosk and ".personal" for your personal Website.)

Please do not take this as "political discourse." I am informing you as a Web Developer whose job it is to ensure that clients are able to enter a market largely supported by other developers, computer scientists, etc. Surely, whatever <em>looks</em>like interpretation or mere opinion or what have you in the above paragraphs, you can take with a grain of salt. I personally am still trying to understand most of what is going on with all of this legislation, and <em>obviously </em>I have not read <em>all </em>of it. I do have a day job, etc.

Of course, at any moment should you wish that I "hand over the keys," please do not hesitate to say so.]]></content:encoded>

Signing a trade agreement is much worse than signing a law.
A law we can fight. We cannot fight an "agreement" to be crooked.

Governments haven't been a Real Thing since Reagan.
Now we're just fighting corporatocracies.
Now all we can fight for is some ghostly picture of Humanity.
And whoever can fit in our arms.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Yet another rant about #sopa</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's great how so many of my liberal and moderate friends have caved to the fear of ACTA, SOPA and all that. It's wonderfully twisted bifurcation which leaves me feeling hollow, worthless, and wholly insignificant. I'm not sure <strong>who</strong> my friends are anymore. As far as I can tell, I'm just a deranged kid who spends way too much time on the Internet, who's fun to poke every once and a while.

Once the Internet comes under attack, everybody realizes they aren't much of liberal-minded folks anyway. So it's a question of "is free speech worth fighting for?" or "is [Internet] free speech worth fighting for?" Losing Internet free-speech is like being told, "You cannot download this onto this device" for most people. "Oh well."

Fantastic. 20,000 strong marching in Poland, and this is what I have to work with. &lt;/hand-holding&gt;

l33ch 0ff t3h Free software m0vement sum moar przz; przz be fashionably 0pen src 4 me (these arguments are old; older than your oldest hip install of Ubuntu)

Most people simply say, "Oh well, it's too much for me!" Everybody searching for heroes, slapping, even further, down all the existential false-positive howls of Satre, etc., etc., etc., the Beats, all the Mystics. Now people are praying for a climate where they can be comfortable in their house-dogmatism.

And I wonder why I just spent 2 hours explaining any of it.

"That's over my head, man! You fight that fight."

Cheers,
/me slapped in the face yet ago.

(And my friends wonder why I'm pissed, with bullshit psychoanalysis. No, you broke my heart by giving up your country. You know who you are, if this applies to you, and you know the only thing I want is to hit that trigger and get you hot. Let yr self-esteem fill in the rest. I'll be focusing on trying to keep yr Facebooks goin'. And cheering on isn't support. Learn how to sshtunnel, motherfucker.)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Indivisibility of Content</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote> A core challenge in realizing these privacy benefits without compromising privacy in other respects is awareness. The content an individual provides that drives their self-representation must be provided with their awareness and understanding of how the aggregation of data contributes as a whole to their online representation. This is particularly challenging for personalized online services with which an individual may not immediately understand the perspective of others viewing them through personalized services.
<cite>&mdash; <em><a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/37673.pdf" title="ABSTRACT: In this position paper, we argue that social media  provides valuable support for the perception of one’s  self and others, and in doing so, supports privacy. In  addition we suggest that engagement, which reflects a  certain degree of trust, can be facilitated by social  information. We support our arguments with results  from a recent privacy survey and a study of social  annotations in search." target="_blank">Vanity or Privacy? Social Media as a Facilitator of Privacy 
and Trust.</a></em> Feb 2012. Jessica Staddon. Google.</cite></blockquote>

My original position is that one cannot die assuming that one has produced sufficient complexity. With user-generated content, these information tycoons (Google, etc.) depend on us for discovery. We are obviously concerned with the inner workings of ourselves.

Autism/Asperger's suggests the naturally (neurologically) engineered acceptance of personal introspection. The capacity for openness without anxiety, but given the appropriate context for expression. That one should express and that the actual description in question be of the relevant kind of evidence.

One does not realize the very real story one tells when they browse the Web. Each Web site keeps an actual .log of hits, but no one cares to store all that data. For Website Analytics, <em>not</em> invading your privacy is a <em>decision</em> we indirectly make because to do so is a practical storage problem.

"We don't really care to know why they hit the site, anyway. We <em>assume</em> it's for the content."

If one has <em>too much</em> content, one engenders "noise." One builds a shroud of semantic gunk to shield one's self, for if it is presumably all valid "for me," in that it is my opinion, what can one do but review it all? The slow process of close and critical perception.

Index me. You'll see nothing with your hands full.]]></content:encoded>

Administration,

Fuck you.

1. Give me my taxes BACK.
2. Stop wasting this economy on bullshit media like this.
3. It IS your fault, you backstabbing, mismanaging, inexperienced assholes.
4. All of the facts that must hold in order for this interview, this disgrace to humanity, to take place. (The amount of money and time it takes to allow him to speak. All that fucking infrastructure and media hardware and jobs.)

We're <em>seriously considering</em> Basketcase for President? This is the talk of the town now? <em>This bullshit.</em> In order for me to be an upstanding and productive citizen, I'm supposed to follow what this fuckwit is saying? And what others are saying about him? 

U.S., "America," Administration, whatever the fuck you call yourself, <em>FUCK YOU</em>. I am NOT being facetious. You have ruined my life and many other peoples' lives with mismanagement, lack of fore-sight, and explicit warmongering. We don't need a fucking Internet Revolution to see you are obsolete. Give me and my Neighbors our fucking taxes BACK. I am NOT being facetious. GIVE BACK RIGHT NOW.

Shut this shit down. This country's too busted to even pretend that it isn't corrupt. Romney's just instructing his apologizers on how they should view the problems of the economy. He's trying to change the grammar of political rhetoric. And he looks like an idiot doing it. I cannot believe these two consenting adults put themselves on camera to be played puppet like this.

This interview is a disgrace to humanity.

To say that bullshit. And moderates and college graduates are talking about him as if he's a viable candidate, in the streets. 

BALLS.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[*Anonymous* means the web is filled with anonymous profiles which use some permutation of the syntactic construction "Anonymous". So, its semantic meaning is diffused through the actual quantification over all agent-messages which bear the name "Anonymous". The name is both vague and exact insofar as a total quantification of Internet communication. (Default) "Anonymous" profiles and (Intentionally Chosen) "Anonymous" profiles stand side by side. This is what is meant by "Expect us." Who sets default identity positions on the Web? The ones who log in to the servers, and prepare the dotfiles and the .conf files? The structure of the Web, the Internet, is built around anonymity. One cannot name the default user, "Steve". The problem starts again: "stevenymous". Akin to Cantor's Proof, "we do not forget" (the convergence of <em>cognitive limit</em> and <em>anti-diagonal</em>).

<cite>— <em>Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics</em></cite></blockquote>
A <em>reader</em> of the Huffington Post writes:
<blockquote>There are many, many medical applications for marijuana. My husband has myotonic muscular dystrophy, at times his hands cramp up so bad he cannot let go of things or he cannot take hold of things. He has had a medical marijuana card for years, when he smokes it or vaporizes it, it relieves these symptoms for him. It is useful for many other applications as well, chronic pain, nausea, dizziness, appetite booster and on and on. It is sinful that more people are not allowed the use of a medicine that is naturally helpful for so many different ailments.
<cite>— @user Koa, <a title="What Your Government Knows About Cannabis And Cancer -- And Isn't Telling You" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Koa/what-your-government-know_b_108712_13847278.html" target="_blank">What Your Government Knows About Cannabis And Cancer — And Isn't Telling You</a></cite></blockquote>
I have gone to jail for having in my possession a drug that helps human beings who suffer from certain pains, like myotonic muscular dystrophy. I went to jail for a drug that helps people, and I paid money out of my own pocket so that I could secure my own freedom.

I went to jail, the facts being as they are.

Why should I be morally admonished by the State because the State cannot figure out how to introduce this <em>herb</em> into its market. I was throw in jail on account of a poverty of the economist's imagination.

Not only am I expected to pay taxes. But, what is more, I am expected to pay for the failures of this country's economic positioning and lack of foresight.
<h2>Personally?</h2>
One day, I tried to self-medicate. I had two major toothaches which I could only resolve through financial means. I worked. I worked, and paid taxes. I worked hard, sometimes ruining my own personal health for my project, my employer, my colleagues, the "design," the "client." Sometimes, this herb makes it incredibly easy to focus, to focus on my project, my employer, my colleagues, the "design," the "client." And sometimes this herb minimized the pain.

I was arrested at a private park by a "patrol" cop who is part of a private organization that largely exists through donation of the private owners of that park. I was arrested for possession of an herb that is widely deployed and dispersed throughout the community around that private park. His sincere justification, after I plead to him how his arrest might affect me? -- "It's fine in your home, but you're out <em>here</em>!" -- The private park of connoisseurs de arte in the middle of a slowly decaying hippie community in Texas.

: Yes. Fuck that. Fuck you. Fuck everything. I will walk the middle of the street. I will kick in your headlight. I will blow up your house. I will take your device. I will vote for you. I will corrupt your children. <em>Mangez-vous tet.</em> Burn your taxes. Post your anti-human flyers. Fight your dog for a day. Tell your grandmother about emptiness on the deathbed in a public hospital. I do not want happiness for humanity. I do not want joy for any person. I want noise. I want drugs. And I want to build. I want to build these things into you. In the words of a great web meme: <em>I am drugs. </em>(TAKE.)

Indeed, a unique, inviting feature of the community, that which attracts youth, upstarts, left-leaning apologists, etc., is that the herb is so highly regarded. Friendships and community are built around the presence of this herb. And I was arrested, in the heart of the community, that park, for possessing it. For possessing an herb that I assumed was helping me "cope." I was arrested while I had nearly 9 work projects at Waste Management and at least 10 personal projects, all dealing with codebases.

These are facts about a person who lives in the United States. I exist. People, like me, exist.

U.S. government: You are ruining not only this economy, but the core value-set that sustains whatever this ad hoc culture has to its merit.

U.S. government: You are a failure and a disservice to humanity.

And now I am to understand that you have undertaken "offensive operations" in the domain of my work, the Internet. Honestly, <em>what the hell do you expect from me?</em> Seriously, Obama, please answer me this fucking question: <em>What the fuck am I supposed to do in a country this blatantly hostile to people like me?</em> -- "Potential Indicators of Terrorist Activities at Internet Cafes"? Seriously? Like, are you assuming I'm illiterate or something? How in fuck's sake is it that adult human beings are authoring garbage like this? And you're signing this garbage? [Ah, side rants.]

STOP fucking me over. And stop trying to argue me out of my hard earned money with your bogus laws, legal taboos, bourgeois catch-22s, hocus-pocus politics, and bureaucratic sleight of hand. I am a human being god dammit. I do not deserve to have my life confounded by the rancorous attitude of a mismanaged War State. And now you want to demonstrate the qualities a prefascist government? At some point, one has only one thing that one can say, "I did <em>not</em> sign up for this."

Stop doing these things and acknowledge the reality of the country <em>you</em> live in.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upwards."

As Eve demonstrates the first expression of toil by taking of the tree. Not born, but created, and as yet to manifest or encapsulate an entire domain of human experience: motivation. And what's more, motivation only exploitable, it seems, by interest in the intellect.

One might call it a by-product of anti-intellectualism, any form of misogyny from Christina thought. Moreover, the Goddess is always the student, the serpent, the Inquisitor, in some fashion or other, in pagan cultures. Witches were, in fact, burn'd for speculation to feats of science, unexplainable by theological yet it was condemned as morally incompatible with the metaphysical tenets of theology. With no substantive or quantitative thinking at all! No utilitarian thinking! Simply women exploiting the "laws of nature" as the laws of nature defined by Orthodox metaphysics. _Behind that_ there is the underlying question of the necessary quality of the world, insofar as it must be, for any feat of witchcraft to hold: we would have to admit the ignorance of science _as accepted_! Better to preserve that than admit the scientific commitments of the church. Nevertheless, what was "heretical" was the _proletarian scientist as woman_: a tinkerer of the economic status quo through a liberatory mode of thought. Whatever truth holds to witchcraft it amounts to the woman as a manipulator of "trouble," and in a sense an undertone of anxiety toward what is woman: that it is not man. And that man is born unto that which the woman weaves. 

By the scripture, we must question what "woman" is "born unto," if anything at all. A close-friend asserts, in absurd jest, as I jerked that it was unimaginable that he should have a mother at all, "I punched my way through non-existence." By the scripture, "woman" is in a certain sense "removed" from the cycle of birth, and in essence is the product of creativity and action. The document enshrines a metaphysic: woman follows from activity. 

And yet woman is condemned by following the dictates of her nature. Her elixir: understanding. That her weakness should be empathy for understanding.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In response to: <a href="http://thedailycougar.com/2012/01/25/net-on-fire/" target="_blank">Net on Fire</a>

[pencil illustration of Internet Explorer icon "e" recently set aflame with match from a "SOPA"-labeled matchbook]

Oh my god. At best Micosoft was conflicted over the specific SOPA document, but expressed interest in seeing it revised. Your graphic here so utterly misinforms the reader and regular citizen on so many levels it is a disastrous and irresponsible act. It is a shame that Daily Cougar policy might involve that debate correspond to the continued existence of this artwork. And flavors and style of argument paying homage to religious persecution and political freedom of speech will be the facade and shroud of validity presumably underpinning the artwork.

When simply put it is radically idiotic. That is simply what it is. The stupidity of the browser wars back again. The big blue "e" in large part caused this mess. By hindering the rate of technological development, by going to war with Netscape, Firefox, Webkit, open source browsers and free browsers. And all the free software that comes with developing browser extensions. Instead, Microsoft primarily enabled the market of anti-virus software and "firewalls." To generate revenue for hardware manufacturers. And this stuff hardly enriches anyone's life in any meaningful sense. Most respond, "WTF is a router? A fire-what?"

Microsoft enabled that schisms in our understanding of technology. This company engendered a climate of fear and reaction either through the unsophisticated release of the browser helper object system, or by sheer bad security practice. Whatever the case, Microsoft is no martyr. In no way should Microsoft stand for the loser here. This graphic totally ignores history of anti-trust against Microsoft, that the battle was over IE appearing on desktops and throttling the market in their favor. This graphic fails to acknowledge an entire era of technology, and fails to say the right this. It is a tragedy that it should exist in a system of culture that blindly endorses any quality of thing for the sake of expression itself. That it must express itself blindly and without apology.

Perhaps this is the way things must be. That second-class citizenship should come to technology. Even our plight, as developers of IE, Opera, Firefox, mobile, etc. Builders of the Web: that such a graphic as this should exist, which totally fails to capture any truth on the way the world was and is today. The graphic is a complete lie, and fails to successfully communicate any truth except the capacity for the author's ignorance, surely enough, in the midst of the war itself. A war which, certainly enough, Microsoft helped obscure and screen with anti-intellectualism through mass production and questionable software development practices.

In any event, we win:

<object width="940" height="508" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/euZivv8ySyA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="940" height="508" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/euZivv8ySyA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object>

That graphic loses. It is a complete fail whale. It is sad that no one at this news organization sees this. And they won't. People who build the web should be absolutely in shock.

This graphic is like putting Hitler on the Cross. It is "Elizabeth Stanton" in interracial porn. It is a jew eating six pounds of ice cream. It is a fresco of the gaping, burning, smoldering holes of the remains of the twin towers representing a power outlet. It is an ex-black panther taking a shit in "Fountain" for the first surreality photography remix of Found Antique Efficiency.

The Universe just took a shit on me. (<em>I cannot make this shit up.</em>)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are at the tape. Imagine a culture devoted not only to its own machinations, but machination, automation, meditation, in itself.

In no other place does "cowboy" or "hypercritical Marxist social deviant" or or "cognitive enhancer" ("cog druggie", it'll make sense when we get there) or "phenomenological investigator" on and on, and then "Hacker" constitute social schema. This world has realized its function, yet it would be folly to blame or lament the machine.

The Web is a draft for culture. In it, from its linguistic axioms and rules for mutation, modation, motivation, modulation on and on, real communities will undertake formation and emergence of self, identity and whole. Real communities, vying for resources, will witness pause, a kind of invert'd Babylon, wherein silence becomes a key. A world of <a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/">languages</a> we must understand as an ecological parameter which must be tweaked. Bloody fuck you, that Text is still on a Page!

Even my brethren acknowledge the Rule and Stead, the Storm and Stress of existence. No matter how small, We are material things.

: And so we respect the idea of <em>ramadan prayer kabbalalalah troublesome. </em>But we express these ideals, and these <em>organic</em> traditions, and we <em>work.
</em>: We do not eat, yet it is more fun to compute. Like music. Like the other thing you do. It is felt in the fingers, and in the mind.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In response to the notion: <em>Be hated.</em>

Why respond to it? <em>When </em>should one respond to it? In truth, it reeks of nihilistic propaganda. So in the most abstract way, it's difficult, tenuous, anti-tangible nonsense. In conversation, it's the <em>dejected platitude; </em>in business, now today, no longer the <em>sensationalist con conservative</em>, it is new revenue fulcrum parlance. Politically under-utilized <em>developers qua workers</em>,<em> underprompted, underestimated subjects </em>of the <em>general purpose-network </em>have been baptized as the new <em>laborer </em>on which capitalistic and socialistic, indeed all political theories describe theories of polity.

And this might be New Black rhetoric. <em>Let me tell you something, --</em>

As they might <em>boldly </em>say.

<em>Being hated </em>was engineer'd, in you, brotha. Look at how we in the upper crust of the black community employ affirmative action, the eternal power grab manifesto, enshrined in legal papers and contract negotiations. In everyday conversation, it is stigma. It isn't funny. It can't be, as the history of africa re-emerges biologically. <em>Some point </em>must exist where genetic traits <em>tend to prevail</em>. The slave trade has been culturally desensitized as it has become subsumed to the war of political economy. It's Earthshakers and Black Sheep --

-- Nevertheless, evolution plays fairly, routinely, as if a regular sweep. The flap of a wing describes the width of culture. Hand a block of Lego to other species, and they might see a civilization. Why not? <em>What indeed is </em>analysis<em>? --</em>

These blacks here in the states gradually sustain'd a trend to consumerism. It's just another mode of content. Now today, in 2012, <em>developers </em>see the utility in contracted humility, unabash'd presentation, ostentation of intellect, and the robe of the Black Sheep. Affirmative action, for blacks, codified legally a disposition to their issues; now today, <em>developers </em>do this for theirs.

Indeed, Reddit appear'd blackface on Bloomberg. Call this a defense: <em>What indeed is </em>analysis<em>? What are </em>ethnic qualities, and how might we consider them as points of contingency through which we might determine economic predictions<em>? That is: </em>Does the analogy fit, or not? I'll call the black out a disgrace. Predictable. I call it a new black. Everyone is saying it, so let's own it. <em>Hacker, Cracker, Blacker. </em>Again, <em>I</em> am a <em>virus</em>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our problem is that no one understands evolution. So all the fucking talk about metanarratives and their adoption is obviously hocus-pocus bullshit. The Logos, the Philos, the subconscious lullabies that drift into every conversation, the whispers of archaic archetypes, the rabble of analytic pseudo-investigation/dividedby/contigenital linguistiquation. Fuck you. Psychologists are the first to hit the wall, obviously. No one understands what the philosopher is <em>saying</em>, and the poor association in the public's perception of the two leaves us demanding philosophical rigor from an inadequate science <em>de rigueur</em>. Psychology has been abandoned for decades, actually. What we've realized is that no science is worth <em>doing.</em>

Automation wins again. Soon when I say <em>I can automate that </em>one will <em>get the gist. </em>This type of talk will be run-of-the-mill, facon de parler, shoppetalk, common parlance, ordinary language, blah blah blahs, and certainly non-sensationalist. Will you fucking understand, or will you remain jobless in a world of machines? (Fancy that, even a <em>machine </em>is better than you. As 3D printers come to fruition, you kiddos who disdain argumentative discourse will come to see why it is so important. Our means for production are <em>losing risk </em>even in market scenarios, and they are widely deployable, as <em>means for production. </em>Like apache webservers, which are used to <em>build the Web, </em>devices like 3D printers <em>enable </em>certain types of economic decisions, like whether or not one should hire <em>you </em>or prepare a shop that centers on the existence of a fashionable, technosthetic. This is why old fashion'd coffeeshops like my own <em>disapprove </em>of e-cigarettes <em>inside. </em>

<em>It's not good for you if the government wants to enable these policies for economic-governance faster than you are given time to adapt to the machine.</em>)

Our intelligence demands zero work. Will you get that? This is what separates us from animals. Evolution demands that the species which can cheat <em>work</em> (<em>labor</em>) for its survival, that species transcends all environments (contexts) for survival. The environment determines a range of <em>work scenarios</em>. <em>Survival </em>does not necessitate <em>environment </em>though if <em>environment </em>is given, survival deterministically follows work scenarios (ends, telos, the modal expression of attribute).

The assumption is that <em>the smart survive </em>is a fact of nature. That's why psychologists started calling their ideas facts. People buy this. Look at you. Your comfortable ego now nested in swathes of psychological gunk, thick in an industry that is authority-bound. And now their words and statements, loosely strung together and yet more blissfully sewn into your televisions and media stations, are your armament. In a world that is prepared to <em>shoot </em>ordinary language.

I speak many languages beyond English, and not one of them is <em>natural </em>or <em>formal. </em>They are languages of the mind.]]></content:encoded>

I <em>trust </em>my judgment. Why do I constantly find myself being intellectually belittled by people who just do not fucking know more than me on this subject, and, truth be told, on a wealth of other subjects? I mean, holy fuck. Look at the "difficulties" and ask yourself, "Do I even fucking remember the last thing he was talking about?"

<blockquote>Some adolescents with Asperger’s syndrome realize they have difficulties with empathy and understanding the emotions of other people, and develop a special interest in creating situations and making statements as a ‘psychological experiment’ to be able to predict someone’s emotional reaction. The statements can be extremely disturbing for the subject in the experiment: for example, an adolescent informing his aunt, in a way that is credible, that her much-loved pet has just been killed by running in front of a passing car. The act or ‘experiment’ is malicious and intended to explore or enjoy the emotional reaction of distress or fear in someone. The subject of the experiment is unlikely to have done anything to justify an act of retaliation. The only link may be that the subject is a happy person who is successful in the areas of ability that are elusive for the person with Asperger’s syndrome.

Remember when <em>the agora</em> burned down during Halloween? "How would you all feel if agora burned down?" (To a group of 10+ 20-somethings, <em>bearing in mind my adoration for the coffee shoppe.</em>) -- Great. I'm glad I got that figured out. Prepare to get axed. I'm getting fucking sick of being exploited/manipulated based on the fact that I don't <em>look</em> autistic.
<blockquote>Hans Asperger, who published a pioneering account of autism in 1944, remarked on the ethereal beauty of his patients almost as if it were a diagnostic symptom.</blockquote>
<em>No</em>, that last joke isn't because I'm the token black guy and I'm "aware" of this, as a utilitarian-capitalist (like everyone assumes, including political theorists — oh my!), in this post-modern, post-colonial, post-colloquial, post-compassionate, post-scarcity-nigh-post-apocalyptic power-gestalt you call "civilization." It's because I'm the token Aspie that you failed you recognize.
<blockquote>I just fucking assumed <em>I</em> could have a conversation with a human being.

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Code outside. Always. Code monkey right? Write in a tree.</span></span>

In the Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome, Attwood suggests a model with which to understand the neurological story, in terms of a functionalist-position. The "social module" along with other abilities grows over time. Aspies tend to have a neurologically stunted "social module" sapling.

We should extend this reasoning to the "computer as part of the human phenotype" (Pemperton). Hu-mans who tend to overuse Facebook should be viewed, as we would view an Asperger's patient, as meeting a criterion for possessing a poorly developed "computer" module. Put it this way: Some of us learn language faster than others. For some of us, it's highly interesting that we might not learn to vocalize until 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years of age. Whatever the age, there's a cut off. Many of these hu-mans simply are not picking up. In a sense, they are along an Asperger's like spectrum where they are "blind" to their innate tech abilities. (I, for instance, can dual type at 30WPM on two standard keyboards. Why should I need this ability? -- But I have it. tpoped out vim with powerline, nerdtree, and other goodies, etc.)

I mean, just take the analogy! (a general description of Asperger's):
<ul>
	<li>A lack of social understanding [<em>comparison</em>: lack of tech understanding],</li>
	<li>limited ability to have a reciprocal conversation [<em>comparison</em>: even if online, people resort too Broken 1337lish], and</li>
	<li>an intense interest in a particular subject are the core features of this syndrome [<em>comparison</em>: meformers; they are solipsistic in a way, as if it were a fact that there's no good etiquette (no content to the concept), as some unruly Aspie kid's behavior might suggest -- except here: as if it were a fact that there's no content to claims about CISPA, NDAA, GMOs, Rick Perrying, etc. (no content to these issues since there's disproportionate growth to the "me module.")].</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am not a "cyclist." I am a person who rides a bike as my primary mode of transportation. I have no clique or gang or group. There is no "manifesto." I am person who simply chooses to ride his bike because doing so enables a kind of harmony in his body. I feel better when I ride. My breathing is better. My thinking and imagination are better.

However, drivers typically assume that I am a "cyclist." That by riding at all, I must have political interests and awareness. I am aware of the laws as they apply to me, and that is it. The "politics" is a waste of my time, just as most "drivers" overlook the politics of their primary mode of transportion. How often are you "surprised" by a raise in gas prices, or that bicycle riders in most areas are technically defined as "vehicles" by traffic law?

It doesn't make any sense when the bottom line is this: The potential for bodily harm _on_ a bicycle is greater than that of a being _in_ a car. Drivers of cars are in a _comfortable_ position to make decisions: most cyclists STRUGGLE to get to that point in their careers as "cyclists." Imagine that you are learning stick shift: Where else do you get genuine training than simply being on the road, and gaining experience through that practice? Cyclists, or bicycle riders, must gain experience on the road. Drivers should bear that in mind when they are driving, that cyclists are practicing their craft, or that cyclists are training themselves to be more cautious bicycle riders.

So many considerations are not taken by drivers of motor vehicles, such that poor etiquette and rudeness become determining factors in the _lives_ of other people. Think about this: RUDENESS is a determining factor in whether or not a cyclist encounters a wide range of types of bodily harm. Car drivers feel comfortable to "tease" cyclists or "educate" them with their cars, or to simply drive as if the cyclist only has something to learn about the "realities" of car driving. This is unacceptable. I will not be taught a lesson by some driver making comfortable decisions from their car-sofa.

Moreover, under no circumstance is it acceptable to honk at a cyclist UNLESS a driver is concerned with properly making clear that reason for which they have honked. Most drivers use horns to bring awareness to other drivers, rarely to educate, but this social function does exist. Frequently I find myself honked at, while a driver attempts to multi-task driving, putting away their currently used mobile phone all the while screaming at me through a closed window. This is unacceptable, too.

Henceforth, I will carry a (1) large knife and (2) my rope lock. If you honk at me with no genuine attempt to raise awareness to the situation (I don't see why this is necessary in the first place, no one [falls asleep at the handlebars].), or because I am riding "too slow", I will use (2), as I see fit, to bring it to your attention that you are acting inappropriately and unnecessarily. No cyclist needs a horn to be "made aware." The cyclist is attempting to be aware as possible, as they MUST be in order to operate their vehicle. Drivers have various devices and opportunity to allow their car to perform semi-automatically. THAT is why the horn exists. No such automatic feature exists for a bicycle. Horns, I repeat, do not apply to bicycles.

Henceforth, safety provisioning requires ONE (1) bike to a lane, and indeed, the center lane. If a car is legally required to take the road, then a cyclist MUST operate their vehicle in the safest possible way. By my own reasoning, this requires that AUTOMOBILES take the rightmost lane, while cyclists maintain whatever speed they see fit to ensure safe cycling to their destination IN THE CENTERMOST LANE. If drivers do not acknowledge this, they will be warned with (1) or (2) however it is best seen fit to educate them.

Drivers who intentionally flout traffic law and safety etiquette will be attacked with (1) or (2).

Other tactics for warning or bringing awareness, either in the political or in a practical, immediate scenario, may include: (3) kicking any available zone on the car, (4) flipping open (and taking) the gas tank lid, (5) paint for marking hostile drivers, (6) U-tapping (U-lock tactics), (7) bean pelting, etc.]]></content:encoded>

</ol>
<h2>Fig. 1, Grice's Maxims:</h2>
<blockquote>The maxim of quantity, where one tries to be as informative as one possibly can, and gives as much information as is needed, and no more.

The maxim of quality, where one tries to be truthful, and does not give information that is false or that is not supported by evidence.

The maxim of relation, where one tries to be relevant, and says things that are pertinent to the discussion.

The maxim of manner, when one tries to be as clear, as brief, and as orderly as one can in what one says, and where one avoids obscurity and ambiguity.</blockquote>
<h2>Fig. 2, an excerpt from J. Lynch:</h2>
<blockquote>##Prepositions.
Prepositions are usually little words that indicate direction, position, location, and so forth. Some examples: to, with, from, at, in, near, by, beside, and above.

A quick-and-dirty rule of thumb: you can usually recognize a preposition by putting it before the word he. If your ear tells you he should be him, the word might be a preposition. Thus to plus he becomes to him, so to is a preposition. (This doesn't help with verbs of action; show + he becomes show him. Still, it might help in some doubtful cases.)

##Prepositions at the End.
Along with split infinitives, a favorite bugbear of the traditionalists. Whatever the merit of the rule — and both historically and logically, there's not much — there's a substantial body of opinion against end-of-sentence prepositions; if you want to keep the crusty old-timers happy, try to avoid ending written sentences (and clauses) with prepositions, such as to, with, from, at, and in. Instead of writing “The topics we want to write on,” where the preposition on ends the clause, consider “The topics on which we want to write.” Prepositions should usually go before (pre-position) the words they modify.

On the other hand — and it's a big other hand — old-timers shouldn't always dictate your writing, and you don't deserve your writing license if you elevate this rough guideline into a superstition. Don't let it make your writing clumsy or obscure; if a sentence is more graceful with a final preposition, let it stand. For instance, “He gave the public what it longed for” is clear and idiomatic, even though it ends with a preposition; “He gave the public that for which it longed” avoids the problem but doesn't look like English. A sentence becomes unnecessarily obscure when it's filled with from whoms and with whiches. According to a widely circulated (and often mutated) story, Winston Churchill, reprimanded for ending a sentence with a preposition, put it best: “This is the sort of thing up with which I will not put.” [Revised 12 Jan. 2007.]</blockquote>
Write and talk appropriate to your audience. The most illuminating feature of the Scripture is that its author <em>aims to speak</em> both to the <em>current audience</em> and a <em>lasting audience</em>, regardless of its metaphysics. The Scripture has itself a Theory of Linguistic Provenance. For instance, the idea of a roll call as a perlocutionary speech act, its perlocutionary force of [having had organized or ordered history]. So, then, the Scripture, for instance, suggests to us a way for fitting names into a scientific edifice by logical presentation. The audience, then, is not simply you, but anyone who might understand the procedure of listing names in such a fashion, as more, such that the text [makes sense]. What is important here is the [maxim of manner] and the [maxim of quantity], the author writes for, in principle, all audiences, from a presentation of a finite number. Is the speaker [successful]?

Your audience in some cases might be your self. Determine what criteria you demand for a successful "talk exchange" such that shared knowledge may be produced, rather than actionable results (we should ignore implementation details).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Commonality and the Myth of Diagnosis</h2>
<blockquote>Another unusual feature of conversations is a tendency to make what appear to be irrelevant comments. A statement or question can be made that is not obviously linked to the topic of conversation. These utterances can be word associations, fragments of the dialogue of previous conversations or seemingly quite bizarre utterances. It appears that the child says the first thought that comes to mind, unaware how confusing this can be for the other person. The reason for this feature remains elusive but may be associated with a tendency to be impulsive and less able to formulate a logical structure or sequence for the statement or description, and an inability to consider the perspective of the other person. When this occurs, you are unsure whether to respond to the irrelevant comment or continue the conversation as if it had not occurred. I tend to ignore such comments and focus on the central theme of the conversation.
— <em>The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome</em>, Tony Attwood</blockquote>
Many of my "close" friends have rejected the idea that I have Asperger's Syndrome. Since I'm <em>young-looking </em>and <em>attractive</em> it's manifest to the layperson that someone <em>like </em>me <em>cannot have Asperger's Syndrome. </em>(It is not a <em>choice</em>; it is a genetic social disorder and neurological outlier which must be <em>observed. Observed. -- Observed. Observation Statements Must Be Produced Which Align with the Generic Psychological Profile.</em> I will type it again. <em>Observation Statements Must Be Produced Which Align with the Generic Psychological Profile. </em>Profiles <em>can </em>be differentiated. That is, they do not <em>exist in a vacuum.</em>) One issue with many of these people is their own insecurities: they think that if someone has Asperger's Syndrome, they must be of the Newton or Einstein sort. Or Daniel Johnston sort. Yes, the one or two anecdotes that make up your knowledge of these peoples' <em>lives </em>are myopic, insufficient, etc. for any genuine talk on Asperger's to be had. If anecdotal evidence is all we have to go on, and meager evidence at that, hearsay if you will, then we might as well talk shoppe about reality TV. Most people simply have no idea of how diagnostic medicine works, so they are incapable of constructive talk on the topic; them, I dismiss.
<h2>The Game of Me</h2>
But some people know me too well. They know I enjoy playing a game called "Nonsense" or "talking absurd." I also have a habit of playing chess alone when feeling self-conscious, insecure, low self-esteem. This was my past-time during high school since it took me years to adjust from <em>Year-around</em> elementary school.

Along with IRC roleplaying, Lego building as a special interest, hacking, reading (reading for me, in a personal setting, actually began with reading D&amp;D Manuals; throughout high school my friends would constantly attend the local mall, where for me it possessed a storehouse of D&amp;D Guidebooks and a Comic Book store which provided a lofty atmosphere to read the Core Rulebooks -- this means that I was able to learn how to read literature, starting from virtually only D&amp;D Manuals, ranging from Hamlet, Plato to Spinoza, Quine, etc. within a period of ~six years -- I read through the <em>Ethics </em>before the age of 22, and I was actually able to demonstrate, naturally, concepts of Substance, Mode and Attribute, Human Bondage, and various of Spinoza's Proofs shortly after reading, though I read it again <em>because I felt that I had no idea of what these words meant</em>), installing/uninstalling Windows -- I clocked 40+ successful installations during my second "summer" of high school, building/dismantling/re-constructing various devices including but not limited to: computers, automatic torque control systems, bicycles, personal Lego concepts, most toys, chess games, recipes, <em>Pokémon</em> card decks, MTG card decks, yo-yos, CD, VHS players and car stereo systems, various car parts, repair and hardware tools, poems, remote control buttons, skateboards. Naturally counting became a past-time: tires, geometric figures, buttons, shoes, houses, signs, cups, nonsense jokes, tables, cracks, cigarettes, Legos [to emphasize this point: children with Asperger's are often untidy if their special interest <em>preoccupies </em>their time; my mother was <em>too busy with work </em>to <em>prevent </em>the 10-12, 14, 16-hour blocks of time I spent dedicated to LEGO. Ultimately I found myself to have produced hundreds of imaginary friends, each embodied in a Lego person. By a certain point, my entire room had become my "universe" where I had rebuilt all Aquazone, Spyrius, "Nascar", etc. according to my imagination (<em>I possessed</em> no <em>prebuilt constructions</em>.), along with "moonwalker" type "heros" (basically, simplistic <em>gundam-</em>style LEGO constructions with cockpit-human hybrid anatomies (cockpit, torso, wings, arms, legs, variously styled weapons: grappling hook, high-pressure aqua mini-gun -- think a mini-gun fire hose --, flame thrower, blasters of variety, etc.; and ballistics) who <em>protected me during my sleep </em>and <em>established peace throughout the quadrants.</em> I employed the LEGO system to produce a custom universe of my own. Each quadrant of my room was the "domain" of each, roughly, predefined "style" provided by LEGO which I highly tweak'd to my imaginative preferences. -- At the same time, my room was often a mess, to the chagrin of my mother. I constantly slept with Legos on bed and floor, and sometimes I slept on the floor. Legos draped the walls, hidden nooks of the room, shelves, the TV, underneath bed, dressers, the bed, etc., in preparation for the events of the next day. This <em>special interest </em>lasted for nearly 7 years before I transitioned to other special interests, the aforementioned, and more OCD-like behaviors: popping fingers, bending/poking nose, squeezing wrist, etc.], ...

One of my fondest tactile memories with LEGO is the squeezing and securing of blocks together. Often I would systematically scour my room for "loose constructions" due to the wear-and-tear of play. Typically others were allowed <em>to play </em>with constructions, but never to <em>dismantle </em>or <em>reproduce. </em>I actually ended a very young friendship because he attempted to customize a <em>moonwalker </em>(I actually still possess the original "prototype" "Moonwalker" and its analogous "heros" ("Hermes", unidentified Aquazone hero -- since "space" was entirely my room, I decided that something like "UFO" applied to the "waters" of the Universe. So, space was not "mysterious", yet places like Atlantis (Aquazone) remained so; there remains an unfinished idea, that would have taken the style of something like a <em>Transformer</em>, which came about once I encountered the "Nascar" LEGO theme)<em>. </em>

<em></em>Some days, however, I would not play with children if I did not wish for them to touch constructions. There were numerous occasions where if this <em>mood </em>occurred in the time of <em>play </em>I would become incredibly hostile and vocally hateful toward other children. It was rare, however, that I would actually <em>take </em>constructions from them because doing so would <em>involving touching that person. </em>Again, I ended a second very close friendship once my friend informed me that he found LEGO to be "boring." (He said this in passing, and what he meant was something like "at that particular time in the day." However, he would at times <em>pester </em>or <em>bully </em>me as regards what I've built. At one point, over a weekend, we actually clashed physically over a particular construction, causing it to shatter on the floor. We became more physically aggressive toward each other after this, displacing LEGO as a shared interest, replacing it with trampoline wrestling and BB Gun Duels. I shot him in the leg once before we stopped. He almost hit my right eye as I tried to confirm clearance from behind a tree, poking my head from behind a shielding tree.)
<h3> Video Games</h3>
I am incredibly talented at Soul Caliber 2. To be candid, and not at all facetious: you <em>cannot </em>beat me at this game. Imagine, moreover, that the character <em>Talim </em>statistically takes the path of least resistance for her maneuvers. Often my "competitive" play at Soul Caliber 2 involved "lying down to defuse the momentum of battle", seemingly aimless jump-kicks and obnoxious sidestepping such that the camera of the game environment caused a kind of dizziness which I found stimulating. Most of the time, after a match, I would find myself surprised that I had won. At the arcades, I quickly became a spectacle. Others, on some occasions, when the game was popular, would ask if I had won any "competitions." Most video games I play expose a certain level of its mechanics/physics through the <em>styles of play. </em>Most players choose a <em>style</em>, I often choose to understand the mechanics of the game. So, for instance, my Street Fighter 3rd Strike (think of a 2D platform fighting game with "counters") career mostly involved Sean, a character who primarily exists within a negative space of the game's mechanics. His frame-rates are slower, less predictable, his Hadouken lags, and he rolls. He rolls. And he has a flamboyant boomerang kick. It's the best fucking Ex ever. His hurricane kick looks like he's dancing with himself, in the air. Most SF3 players, especially those at the arcade, found my tactics and strategies obnoxious. Some even <em>groaned </em>as I took the controller.
<h3>Systematic Downloader</h3>
Downloading music and files in general quickly became a past-time. I quickly amassed nearly 200GB of music in high school, which I deleted wholesale years later. I now sit on a store of 350+GB of music. Most of which consists of obscure math rock, discographies, newer Klezmer music and fusions, Jazz, progressive rock, emo and screamo, noise, etc.
<h3>Typetiquette</h3>
Often others note my type etiquette. I use punctuation.

As mentioned before, I took on roleplaying, shortly after, displacing somewhat, the special interest in Lego. Daily I joined IRC and AOL roleplaying chats which demanded word minimums for actions, robust descriptions of character backgrounds and agency in the environment or universe of the theme (Cowboy Bebop, DBZ, modern D20, D&amp;D). We authored short stories and short novel-length spinoffs daily, and it had to be something we'd want to read in a book. My career as a typer is largely governed by my treatment of typing as a means to produce <em>stories </em>or <em>scripts. </em>I undertook roleplaying for nearly 2 years, often spending 6 to 7 hours a day at it; this was approximately between the ages of 12-14. Naturally I took to the MUD and eventually "left the scene" once my Interest in roleplaying gave way to an interest in <em>communication systems</em>; i.e., the Internet, TCP/IP, "protocols", etc. Often I wondered how we could <em>agree </em>on the protocols of our roleplaying. Often, I introduced the "meta-gamer's problem."
<h3>A Handshake</h3>
Often other males fail to acknowledge the social custom of <em>handshake. </em>I do not. Usually this is <em>the</em> <em>game of you. </em>A handshake homogenizes the social order; moreover, it is a form of trust establishment. In my mind, it resembles the <em>looking in the eye of a murderer. Skin touching </em>restores <em>trust </em>at the most basic level. It took me nearly a decade before I would <em>touch others </em>or <em>to allow myself to be touched. </em>For years I would not touch the same silverware, glasses, plates, and often times simply <em>things </em>of other people. Over the years, I have used the <em>handshake </em>to over time build a <em>proclivity for touching </em>through the effort to shake people's hands. My handshakes are awkward because they are my coping mechanism for a deeper problem, the problem of <em>touch in social contexts. </em>A handshake, first, prepares me for the possibility of future touch by the agent, such that the mere touching may be immediately predicted, and thus less capable of producing anxiety.
<blockquote>In stage two of friendship, children develop greater cooperation when playing with their peers and develop more constructive means of dealing with conflict. It is important that the child with Asperger’s syndrome learns the theory of, and gains practice in, various aspects of cooperative play using Social StoriesTM and role-play activities. These can provide practice in aspects of cooperative play such as giving and receiving compliments, accepting suggestions, working towards a common goal, being aware of personal body space, proximity and touch, coping with and giving criticism, and recognizing signs of boredom, embarrassment and frustration and when and how to interrupt. The role-play and modelling of aspects of social interaction such as giving compliments can be recorded on video to provide practice and constructive feedback (Apple, Billingsley and Schwartz 2005).
-- <em>The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome</em>, Tony Attwood</blockquote>
<h2>Motivation, Identity Adjustment</h2>
In truth, I did not begin any personal reading of books until roughly this age. That is, I did not begin to read books until roughly 14-15, almost 16. I actually never read more than 100 pages <em>because of</em> high school -- I'm talking Hamlet, Homer, Dickens, Aristotle, just about everything from Victorian Literature and American Literature presented, etc., though I took Dual Credit English, etc.; them, I dismissed. (Poems were read, however. -- You might stand aback, aghast and wonder: "But all that fine authorship and culture, you philistine!" Considering the topic: <em>Shut the fuck up. </em>Obviously "continental authors" and more recent philosophy post-19th century were not presented. I approached my then English instructor once about this.) <em>But</em> which isn't <em>much </em>of an achievement considering that I grew up in Texas, and IPS(?) and AP test forms exist, along with more "rigorous" systems. (Often during standardized tests, like the high school AP Exam and throughout uni, I would wonder: How did <em>this </em>question get to <em>this </em>position on the exam. Considering how Web forms are presented, my <em>attempt </em>to answer test questions were at odds with the typographical/design algorithms which must need map to the True in order to map to <em>Correct </em>answers. How would you break down a Web form? -- In terms of quantity of input elements, presence of legends, answers predetermined, but if randomized over a form, those numerical qualities determine domains for which answers are in the range.) I quickly devised a method of reading which involved reading the first sentence and the last sentence of every paragraph, and ignored various topics based on subheadings. I FAILED high school chemistry used this method. I FAILED college engineering physics using a method similarly fashioned. I succeeded at Dual Credit English using this method. (An additional point, I <em>actually </em>submitted a <em>Tractatus</em>-styled paper, dealing with the logical structure of "naive realism" -- logically presented propositions conforming to a numerical syntax for premise/conclusion relation -- to my Epistemology professor during uni. I <em>actually requested </em>deduction for <em>lateness </em>to complete it. Listen, do you know what Tractatus <em>looks like? </em>(Conversation in the interpersonal vocal domain just seems to fail on <em>demonstrating </em>this point, since most people wish to talk catpiss or trollwars or real talk anyway.) I'll stop fucking <em>talking</em> about it and <em>just show you</em>, so that you get my <em>point</em>:

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://aauerbach.info/images/wittgenstein/590/tractatus_57.jpg" alt="" />

I produced a 7-page paper, resembling <em>that. Spinoza </em>does the same thing. <em>Ethics Demonstrated in Geometric Order </em>was my <em>hopeful calling </em>to finding <em>linguistic peers.</em> I ultimately switched my major to philosophy <em>because </em>I thought this kind of authorship was <em>common, acceptable. </em>Roughly all of my personal writing in moleskins, journals, etc. conform to such a <em>procedure of authorship</em>.)
<h2>The Game of You</h2>
I believe the adoption of this "game" -- Nonsense -- says more about my social peers than about me, or not. But it should be noted: My label for this "game" is in fact my attempt at legitimizing my "word associations, fragments of the dialogue of previous conversations or seemingly quite bizarre utterances." True, it may be a game, and a fun one, where people play word-games and craft puns with one another in a kind of communal linguistic activity. Others will feel nostalgic about "Nonsense" and wonder why we don't play as often. I do not wonder these things. "Nonsense" is a name of a game I gave to one of my symptoms. As with many people who have Asperger's, I have a hypersensitivity to sonic- or aural-generating high frequency/high decibal devices. Electric cars, TVs, mobile devices, phones, AC units, large industrial machinery requiring complex inner-circuity and signaling systems, radios, microwaves, car horns, etc. Daily my life is riddled by the sonic textures of various frequencies and decibal levels. "Nonsense" is my attempt at maintaining analogical/dialectical dialogue ("It's 'like'..."-talk but over concepts, instead of events or persons -- "He's like a bitch"; "The car crash -- it was like, ridiculous"; etc.) to distract me from the barrage of sounds that I am constantly finding myself in the grips of. So I might produce or introduce jokes, analogies, metaphors, non-sequiters, "thought disorders", or monologues, such that others might play with them as well to establish a soundscape which secures <em>thought </em>from <em>actual noise.</em> Many people enjoy the game, wordsmiths and the like. They attribute it to some kind of creativity in my persona or my intellect.

No. I use "nonsense" to re-orient discussion in my favor; for conversation, I introduce a baseline probability that my topic will be touched since, in essence, my topic is the dialectical bridging of topics. This is why philosophy interested me. For the most part, Wittgenstein/Positivism gave me tools for defusing a wide variety of conceptual/cognitive trajectories and tropes that are riddled throughout Western thought. I typically refer to them as "poor conceptual hygiene" (as PMS  Hacker/Michael Bennett do) or "thought <em>ordered</em>". The activity of blending concepts, making them vague, expand, etc. comes from my deficiencies as a conversationalist, my inability to interpret the rhythm of conversation (largely due to noise). "Nonsense" is one of my symptoms. For some reason, my friends, instead of identifying my symptom as a criteria for a social/neurological malfunction, transformed it into a game. My "resets" to conversation, my outbursts, my monologues, impromptu deadpan humour, characters, strange voices, Devil's Advocate, confusing questions ("What does that mean?" in the presence/context of an "everyday concept" as up for discussion), etc. are not taken as deficiencies, but rather virtues. This is not clear to me why. But I would imagine with shows like Twin Peaks and 30 Rock, people dropping "I loved the Pachycephalosaurus as a child" or "I'm a theological non-cognitivist" is just something people say. Hours of nonsense humor is surely something that even the learned engage in. Right.

It's not creativity. It's not competition. I'm not writing a script. I'm not a wordsmith. It's an atypical neurological disposition that undermines the success of interpreting conversational cues. "Nonsense" jokes are my conversational flash bang grenades.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"As mentioned above, drivers should never pass a cyclist if they intend to make a right-hand turn, as they will likely be cutting them off."
--<cite><a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/article/how-to-not-kill-a-cyclist"> How to Not Kill a Cyclist</a> ("How to: Not Kill a Cyclist")</cite></blockquote>
I believe this sentence should be re-written:
<blockquote>"As mentioned above, drivers should never pass a cyclist if <em>either they or the cyclist</em> intend to make a right-hand turn, as they will likely be cutting them off."</blockquote>
This may require explanation. It may not, as it seems deliciously, almost prettily vague. But I might hazard a development of the thought, as I assume, further, that it itself extends the idea: <em>A bike is a vehicle.</em>

<em>Passing a cycling </em>is an idea that captures a wide number of scenarios, or rather: prompts. <em>Should I pass this cyclist? </em>I believe is the interrogative expression of the concept. Indeed, <em>interrogative prompt. -- </em>As a driver, which is quite rarer now, I cannot resist the habit of treating my driver's seat as <em>a driver's sofa </em>and my dashboard, wheel, et al. as well<em> -- oh come on what do you expect me to say?</em> A keyboard. -- It's happened, it's always been there. At any moment, truly, and you see this with web statistics survey software: <em>window.fucking.prompt</em>.

I mean, what does "surfing the web" mean, anyway? Soon we'll be coding in our cars, but that's another story (actually, I would PREFER sometimes to have actual traffic 4-finger swiped away to my vim). What's most important is that for me: driving is <em>effortless.</em> All the internal engineering and ergonomics and consumerism have <em>won. </em>Cars are nothing more than <em>mobile homes.</em> We trash talk white trash: well, <em>trashy people trash people.</em> Only a car driver has any <em>genuine opinion</em> on mobile homes <em>in general</em>. (Sorry, I live in Texas, so this whole issue is a tad close to home.)

<em>Okay, okay. </em>My point is this:
<blockquote>Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race.<cite>
— H.G. Wells</cite></blockquote>
In light of all the comfort and amenities motor vehicles have to offer, some of us prefer the "interface of nature." Is "a bike is a vehicle" a decision or fact? It's both: we are all expected to know the same traffic protocols, rules, and we're all expected to understand our <em>vehicle</em> and that our vehicles physically limit one another while they physically affect us in our operating of them. I believe the initial quotation discloses, through its sweet vagueness, two interesting scenarios:
<ol>
	<li>... drivers should never pass a cyclist if they [as a driver] intend to make a right-hand turn ...</li>
	<li>... drivers should never pass a cyclist if they [the cyclist] intend to make a right-hand turn ...</li>
</ol>
By (1) we see the original article's point. I hardly doubt anyone needs be seriously queried, "Is it a good idea to throw a large log across the road?" Are we simple-minded androids? Perhaps. No, really -- how simple are we? Who genuinely wonders if it is all right to take up the only lane dedicated to bikes? Someone who thinks "a bicycle is a vehicle": All vehicles should obey traffic laws in similar fashion. If a bike wants to turn, it must stop, verify other vehicles, and then turn; if it wants to keep going, it must obey/acknowledge the physical space of other vehicles. This covers the "decision" aspect of the concept of the common thinker, apparently.

But (2) exists. Why? "should never pass" contains a term that can be taken technically or commonly. "Technically" involves everything going on in (1): don't pass slower vehicles. But there's also <em>attempting to pass</em> which is embodied in the question: Should I pass? --

As one is driving, upon entering that interrogative mode of thought, one thing is noticed: passing <em>involves</em> acceleration. The point here? What <em>if</em> the cyclist intends to make a right-hand turn <em>and you happen to be behind her</em>. Should you pass? Should you attempt to pass? Should you accelerate at all? I believe obviously the answer is again "no". A bicycle is a vehicle after all. What's going on when a cyclist makes a right-hand turn? Well, they're operating a vehicle, for one.

Consider this: What does a stick shift driver have to pull off to make a right-hand turn? <em>Exactly.</em> And that's a "vehicle" too. Have you ever considered what a cyclist must pull off in order to <em>safely</em>, <em>comfortably</em> make a right-hand turn, considering the assumption of other vehicles on the road? Typically we think: it's all-right to pass slower vehicles. Naturally, in this case, a cyclist is operating a slower vehicle. Yet, for some reason, people <em>tend</em> to accelerate to speeds as if they were passing a slower vehicle. My question: Why does the circumstance of [a cyclist] making a right-hand turn somehow make it permissible to do the exact opposite of the rule of thumb of (1).

Don't technically pass if, as a driver, you intend to make a right-hand turn; yet driving at speeds resembling technically passing a cyclist is permissible so long as the cyclist is making a right-hand turn.

How about this. If you're a driver, always check for right-hand turns, either in yourself or from others, including cyclists. If you see a cyclist, do not pass. If you see a cyclist making a right-hand turn, do not pass, and do not speed up.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Give up your <em>terrestrial religion</em>.
"<em>Dust</em> to <em>dust</em>."
We are <a title="Confirmed: SpaceX Dragon Ferried ‘Scotty’s’ Remains Into Space" href="http://mashable.com/2012/05/22/spacex-dragon-scotty/">stardust</a>.
"Make your astrofootprint (astral footprint)!"
Etc.,etc., ...

I think such a gesture is a great move to motivate others to recast their religious mode of thought toward a finer jewel than "God": rather, "Space." No pretense is necessary: your ashes do not return to God, or Heaven, to the Earth, God's Creation, or any of that: your ashes become stardust, incompatible with the homeostatic metaphysic of Scripture, of Earth, as a pool of sin. For instance, with this thought, immediately one must give up the doctrine of method, found in Scripture. By "method" I suggest the interpretation: <em>applied method</em>, exampled by use of the Scripture as a guide to scientific knowledge. Moreover, the Scripture, in choosing the twilight graveyard, holds no claim to ethical method. Its text, its God, cannot predict the immeasurable qualities of elemental complexity, the universe itself, the conduit of life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I believe programmers et al. should attempt to play more futball. Just play through the pain of it. You will quickly develop a grammar (like in vim!) which helps with establishing Flow.

Do not work out for your "health" or by dietary theories (which are largely based on Western dietary habits anyway). Work out to understand how Flow can be expressed beyond typing at a keyboard. (Consider that in most contexts where we talk about "Flow," studies involve sedentary activities: playing video games, typing/programming, flying a simulator or an actual air-vehicle, driving, etc.) What is with the given assumption that Flow involves Hands/Brain? Why not Feet/Brain? Imagine being able to establish Flow immediately while engaged in a physically exhausting activity. How far will you go? For how long will you play?

In short time, your body will naturally develop into the kind of fitness appropriate to the limits of your mental limitations. Moreover, you may develop a grammar for your feet which is analogous to the grammar of your hands (in the context of a keyboard -- consider that we all type relatively uniquely to ourselves, a typolect, if you will, despite "Standardized" keyboard formats; in the context of vim -- verbs, nouns, modifiers, sentences, paragraphs, etc.): Foot Grammar (might allow for "propositions" of the foot which demand a fitness level (performance criterion) to express them.

You type through the pain of the monitor against your eyes. You type and think through fluorescent lighting. Carpal Tunnel. Etc. This is why we suggest getting up and stretching, walking about, to combat these minor physical impairments which involve attrition over time. So many physical analogues exist which naturally make playing futball a sensible, and moreover social (!), activity for programmars.

I type through wrist pain and learn a new framework. I kick through foot pain and learn a new tactile passing system.]]></content:encoded>

Shut the fuck up with the blind assent to authoritarian psych schools (<a title="Why Anti-Authoritarians are Diagnosed as Mentally Ill" href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/02/why-anti-authoritarians-are-diagnosed-as-mentally-ill/">again</a>). Stop taking pills. Stop making up placebo psychological predicates. Stop talking about yourself, and start <em>studying </em>yourself. Self-diagnose --

<em>You know how to fucking read.</em>

Class-based Psychology, the product of Industrial-Capitalism, from Jung to Cognitive schools to the Descriptivist-Narrative Schools, is over. From positivism to current political theory, they instill in the media principles to obscure our abilities to understand the world, but as yet they assume that we have these abilities, but misguided. Indeed, stop feeding us the media. Their assumption? That we are all "little scientists," as Putnam would have it, who ultimately yield to the authority of practice in scientific praxis itself.

Well, fuck that. And fuck you.

<em>Be the theorist you want to see in the world.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This thought isn't fleshed out, but it is essentially my initial reaction to the <a title="Kickstarter for a JavaScript top level domain (.js TLD)" href="https://github.com/ozten/TLD.js" target="_blank">following</a>.

So, <em>why not</em> serve JS on a different protocol? "http" is misleading for these resources. CSS as well. Consider css://domain.com/ returns a style guide-like page for GET.

Sure, JS and CSS documents have "hypertext," so it technically is <em>not</em> misleading to continue serving them as such. However, one motivation behind this idea is that <em>hypermedia </em>and <em>hypertext </em>are both served through HTTP/S. But, moreover, <em>hyperresources</em>, let's say, are also served through HTTP/S. For hypertext <em>documents</em>, we expect for there to be a <em>reader </em>who might <em>follow </em>links. In serving JS and CSS over HTTP, are we not assuming that bots, crawlers, etc. are <em>following </em>links in the same way that a human reader might?

Human readers <em>read </em>hypertext. In some cases, we <em>read </em>and follow the links within CSS documents. But ultimately, after optimization and normalization of presentation layer documents, they are rendered <em>intentionally non-readable. Who </em>then is supposed to follow their hypertext except for a narrowly defined <em>reader? </em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In Nietzsche's "Daybreak":
<blockquote>It is not for nothing that one has been a philologist, perhaps one is a philologist still, that is to say, a teacher of slow reading.
<cite>— Friedrich Nietzsche</cite></blockquote>
<blockquote>Besides, we are friends of the lento, I and my book. I have not been a philologist in vain — perhaps I am one yet: a teacher of slow reading. I even come to write slowly. At present it is not only my habit, but even my taste — a perverted taste, maybe — to write nothing but what will drive to despair every one who is ‘in a hurry.’ For philology is that venerable art which exacts from its followers one thing above all — to step to one side, to leave themselves spare moments, to grow silent, to become slow — the leisurely art of the goldsmith applied to language: an art which must carry out slow, fine work, and attains nothing if not lento. Thus philology is now more desirable than ever before; thus it is the highest attraction and incitement in an age of ‘work’: that is, of haste, of unseemly and immoderate hurry-skurry, which is so eager to ‘get things done’ at once, even every book, whether old or new. Philology itself, perhaps, will not so hurriedly ‘get things done.’ It teaches how to read well, that is, slowly, profoundly, attentively, prudently, with inner thoughts, with the mental doors ajar, with delicate fingers and eyes. My patient friends, this book appeals only to perfect readers and philologists: learn to read me well!
<cite>— Friedrich Nietzsche</cite></blockquote>
Instead of "speed reading" I believe Aspie's should intentionally focus the structure of their powers of Special Interest towards books.

Consider Tony Attwood's observations in <em>The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome</em>:
<blockquote>Activities to encourage flexible thinking and the ability to engage in pretend play can include games where the objective is to invent as many uses as possible for a given object – that is, to think beyond the most obvious, functional use of that object. For example, how many uses can be thought of for a brick, a paper clip, a section of toy train track, and so on? The section of train track could become the wings of an aeroplane, a sword or a ladder, for example. This will encourage the ability to ‘break set’ when problem solving and be more comfortable when involved in pretend play with other children.</blockquote>
I, for instance, create mnemonic devices from the First Letter of sentences of significant paragraphs of books. Then I produce a grid that I use as a "conceptual barometer." From a book I'm reading:
<pre style="padding-left: 30px;">S C I C I
T B I A I A
A T I N T H
T I A T A</pre>
Which can be used to memorize as well. If Aspies with decent memory use this, it may help with retention.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The question architects and designs of distributed network applications need to ask is not, "How can a server successfully export its private objects in a way that clients can see and use them?" Instead the question that should be asked is, "How can a server and client share a common understanding of the payloads passed between them?"</blockquote>
<h2>A list of popular responses to the type-marshaling dilemma</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Shared schema</li>
	<li>URI construction</li>
	<li>Payload decoration</li>
	<li>Narrow media types</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Hypermedia Solution</h2>
<blockquote>Relying on payloads based on hypermedia designs avoids the common pitfalls of the type-marshaling dilemma. That's because hypermedia payloads carry more information than just the data stored on the server. Hypermedia payloads carry two types of vital metadata: <em>metadata about the data itself</em> and <em>metadata about the possible options for modifying the state of the application</em> at the moment. Both are important to enabling stable and flexible distributed network applications.
<cite>&mdash; Mike Amundsen, <em>Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 &amp; Node</em> [my emphasis]</cite></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day I enjoyed the park, with a small gang. One of them, a vibrant and reliable member of my local community, has a clinical diagnosis somewhere on the Autism Spectrum (AS). He's older, nearly to his 50s, and in terms of his personality, it is quite apparent his Asperger's. But what is more, what many others may not notice, is that the knuckles on his hands are slightly mutilated. In my mind, upon noticing this, I was immediately compelled to all of those times I've slammed my fists into walls, trees, doors, the ground, the cement, cars, fences, pipes, park benches, brick houses, windows, and so on. Most interesting of all is that Aspies are the one's who, presumably, maintain a great attention to detail, but yet, they are less inclined or less enabled, socially, to assert or express those details. Moreover, others will lack that attention to detail. It seems almost a vicious cycle.

In any event, his knuckles look the worst. But he has no trouble <em>convincing </em>others of his Asperger's. He has fully grown into it, I s'pose. I, of course, on the other hand, have had a difficult time convincing others of my condition. Perhaps my own is mild, or not. Or perhaps I have been successful at merging myself into the social sphere. Or, simply, others lack attention to detail. Often others find me "mysterious" because of my cold demeanor, lack of facial expression or "stealthy" because of my peculiar walking habits (I still "toe walk" -- which is a clinical symptom of Asperger's).

Attwood shares some criteria:

<em>1 Diagnosis of autism in infancy or early childhood
2 Recognition of Asperger's syndrome in early school years
3 The previous diagnosis of another developmental disorder
4 First recognition of the clinical signs in adolescence
5 The suggestion of a conduct or personality disorder
6 Diagnosis of a relative with autism or Asperger's syndrome
7 Recognition of the signs of Asperger's syndrome from the media</em>
<em>8 Employment problems  </em>

As I grow older, I most readily identify with 8. Even my last employer at Waste Management, one of the VPs, made note of the fact that I, at 25, had never held a job longer than a year. I thought my response to that question would break any chance I had at winning the position. -- Most people in daily social life consider Asperger's as a plea for pity or, paradoxically enough, a vying for attention; an expression of one's uniqueness. All the same, Asperger'sisa disorder in many regards, a perpetual developmental disorder that, at some points, affects one person and that person alone: the patient.

However, as a child, 2, 4, and 5 made the most sense. I may entertain 2 and 5 later in life, but at the moment 4 is critical. I, to put it briefly, have dealt with stimming my entire life, sometimes to my dismay. In its most extreme expression, stimming may involve outright self-harm or self-injury. And naturally such behavior frightens neurotypicals.

Weeks back I decided to undertake a bike ride with friends, after the bar, to grab Mexican food. During our ride, I, as per usual, decided to play aggressive. The conclusion was a very precise skid stop into a right-side shoulder dive to the road. Most of the others, once we made it to the restaurant, were simply confused, perhaps even distraught. What they fail to understand is that this activity, this expression of my autistic system, has been a ritual in my life. When I started my career at futball, I gave it an appellation: <em>falling drills. </em>My reasoning is that <em>falling </em>is a limit of the human form; at the same time, <em>rational </em>(or rather <em>reliable</em>) <em>action </em>is possible<em></em> within the context of a fall; a fall is a limit to, not a preclusion of, action. In terms of jeet kune do, a martial arts system I thoroughly enjoy, it means, for me, to express the natural personality traits of water: <em>a fall is an opportunity to conform</em>.<em> </em>Typically my falling drills in futball involve diving or staggering or dropping while still maintaining the well-defined objective: manipulate the ball, either to pass, defer, or shoot the ball.

But I digress. In younger life, my stimming expressed itself as wall-punches, head butts, slamming my face to the desk, breaking broomsticks and various other types of wooden objects over my thighs, or, simply, punching myself in the jaw. I once "knocked" myself out. I realized the joy, or pleasure, inducible by such pain when, as a youngster, I walked into an unlit restroom only to be rudely interrupted by a wall hand-dryer that put me to the floor in a hurry, seeing stars and nearly a concussion. Taking my fist to my jaw was always mild by comparison, but no less pleasurable.

-- What I notice today, however, is that others have begun to question, in a wider sense, my tendency to self-stimulate. For decades I've cracked my knuckles, to the point where my right hand has noticeable damage, and is permanently swollen. Let us be clear: <em>this </em>is a clinical sign of Asperger's syndrome. I made a short career, when younger, of finger-flipping, but most prominent was my wrist writhing, or wrist wringing. In later years I moved to squeezing my nose. There are noticeable bruises on my nose. A manager at Waste Manage once, actually, made a joke about it involving "brown-nosing."

What am I to do when no one will accept my self-diagnosis, and as yet I must endure not only my own symptoms, but the consequences they engender in crude, mean, ugly, nasty humans? <em>What am I to do when, being of a certain level of attractiveness, I must live in a bubble of my own undoing? </em>I keep all the negative comments of the world, which are wholly unfair and hateful. As an Aspie, my memory is nearly supreme, immaculate. <em>Is this a good thing? Am I boasting? </em>Might I have a penchant for facts, science? All the same, I remember when <em>you </em>didn't shake my hand, dissing me. Or when <em>you </em>drafted a nickname for me which was nothing more than an expression of a neurodevelopmental disorder I have very little control over. Rather, stimming <em>is </em>voluntary, under certain <em>activities</em>; but <em>that</em> one should need to self-stimulate at all is not. I can <em>choose </em>when I wish squeeze my nose, or fold my arms, or crack my knuckles, but <em>that I should engage in such activities </em>is part of my psychological profile.

What's more? I have managed to discover tools for <em>systematic stimming. </em>And this speaks to the "wider sense" in which my stimming has become apparent, regardless of the obliviousness of friends and family. These tools involve a rubber tube ring that I stumbled over, months ago, and hair bands. Often people wonder why I wear these things, as if they were some kind of cultural baggage, as if they were expressions of a non-American past. Indeed, this is absolutely not the case.

The hair bands restrict blood flow into my hands, numbing them, but also causing mild discomfort over my wrists. Wrist-writhing nullified.The tube ring has drastically reduced the number of times a day that I crack the knuckle on my right hand, as it is an obstruction which prevents. <em>Knuckle-cracking nullified.</em>

However, what do we make of his mutilated knuckles? What might I be warranted in claiming about him on that bit of evidence alone? -- Months back a lady friend once queried me, "Do you ever get violent?" But well after, I thought, she and I had established a relationship so robust that the answer should be obvious to her, at least in <em>that </em>sense of "violent." Moreover, she asked this based on the hearsay of some other guy who was clearly, and she understood this, trying to get into her pants. But, moreover, Aspies have a tendency to self-harm. So he took one of my symptoms and spun it against me. Do I get violent? Surely. But I also have a history of slamming my head on desks, punching trees, etc., etc., etc.

<em>This</em> is why it is important for people to understand. Because it is easy for people to use my own symptoms against me. I speculate that it becomes a necessary requirement for social maturity that those with Asperger's not only must learn the customs of their peers, but they must also learn to overcome the <em>guilt </em>which follows from <em>others' </em>perception of their clinical signs. Generally speaking, Aspies must not only grow as social agents, despite their forms of "muteness," but moreover they must also learn how to manage how people treat their symptoms. That is, Aspies must develop a system for minimizing psychologically contracted abuse due to their symptoms. Aspies must learn to manage self-directed and other-directed abuse. (Once another lady friend described me as a "table" and more or less commenced treat me as if an inanimate object, wrapping and flailing her legs at and around mine wildly, trying to break the fixed nature of my bodily arrangement. I tend to lack any care for how others treat my body, assuming that I "trust" them, which can be hard-earned for those befriending Aspies. Of course, no one enjoys being "objectified.")]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>What if Asperger’s Syndrome was defined by its strengths? What changes might occur?
<cite>-- <a href="http://www.tonyattwood.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79:the-discovery-of-aspie-criteria&amp;catid=45:archived-resource-papers&amp;Itemid=181">The Discovery of “Aspie” Criteria</a></cite></blockquote>
Look, I'm going to be frank with you. We have, in our generation, Aubrey de Grey talking candidly of Robust Human Rejuvenation, Juan Enriquez speculating that we are witnessing first-hand the evolution of our species: homo evolutis (extreme dietary systems, too-much-information, gene reinforcement, (research) chemicals). Transhumanism is now a viable philosophy. And with the DSM-5, regardless of the bankruptcy of "evidence" in American psychology, we will see a more thorough-going analysis of "Asperger's Syndrome" in terms of a "severity-based" system within the concept of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).

I think that we, as aspies, have a decision to make. Our decision, ultimately, may determine the trajectories of "posthuman discovery." (Moreover, I have a slew of other questions to throw at the topic, chief of them being: How do you, NT, expect me to obey your industrial-capitalist legal system when, for all intents and purposes, such a legal system cannot even viably assess the nature of my intent, someone who is nearly inscrutable, cognitively, to that system. I was put in jail months back, and I cannot understand why. My legal system attempted to "correct" me, but all it did was induce depression and ruin my career as a Web Developer, and a very highly sought after Web Developer in Texas. Or the other point: I will never play futball for the United States. Why should I obey these laws when they do nothing for me except harm? For all intents and purposes, I believe there is a set group of aspies who are "above law.")
<blockquote>If the proposed intervention would result in an enhancement, why have we not already evolved to be that way?
<cite>-- <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Drug%20heuristics">"Algernon's Law"</a></cite></blockquote>
Most obviously the main issue here is choice. For aasimar "being outcasts among their peers during their formative years and being given a significant amount of strange attention from the superstitious" results in, ultimately, the lack of choice in the matter, indeed. When {naturally} one is primed, either through social muteness (being able to focus on details rather than human interaction, be those details linguistic or scientific or what have you) or through one's ability to harness stimming in such a way as to outperform neurotypicals in sporting activities, for enhancement, how at all should it be perceived as a difficult choice for an Aspie? The natural abilities for Aspies offsets them socially and cognitively. -- When I play futball, my finger-flip in order to "release" (or rather regulate) the quantity of stress produced over time which is induced directly from my playing futball, which enables focus, precision, and quite simply, excellence.
<h2>To the point:</h2>
"Aasimar are also quite preceptive, noticing things that others do not..." is stated in the Forgotten Realms supplementary guide. More --

"Even those raised by understanding parents cannot escape their strangeness, or the curiosity [(or even fear) that their unique nature sometimes results in. Many aasimar are even prejudiced against, something that deeply hurts the soul of the aasimar in question since most have an inherent bend towards empathy for others." -- Obviously. More --

"Nearly all aasimar are uncommonly beautiful and still, and they are often significantly taller than humans as well." --
<blockquote>Hans Asperger, who published a pioneering account of autism in 1944, remarked on the ethereal beauty of his patients almost as if it were a diagnostic symptom.
<cite>-- <a href="http://www.paains.org.uk/articles/beautiful.htm">Beautiful Children</a></cite></blockquote>
I am happy with Attwood and Gray's notion of discovery. But in this era, in our time, what we are discovering are the existence of aasimar. I'm not joking with you. Imagine the intersection of ASDs and the 577R gene, what do we discover when we find aspies who not only expression clinical signs but possess the 577R gene?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Let's assume Facebook will cover Microsoft's old turf.</span></span>

That said, I wouldn't want to work through FB/MS anyway (think MS Certs, 'corporate dev bloat' with SharePoint... Now... FB Job Auth API). And I might be able to leverage my 'brand aversion' to isolate dev shops I do wish to work under. They probably would prefer it that I not allow the 'excess' of FB into my life anyway. Or they might simply find FB's brand generally repugnant. All in all, FB won't be leading tech-intersect-science innovation (designer drugs through cool UIs, all the NP-hard problems that come from dual hypertext/image cool URIs, neural networks and actual utilities and ecological solutions). FB, at best, will be the ID/human-auth system for SpaceX.

FB has inherently limited itself to custodian software. Keeping the 'human namespace' tidy. Boring. Like MS and its 'hardware philanthropy' FB just wants to be present with the path of least resistence (PHP anybody?). MS succeeded with its imperative to put hardware everywhere, and they naturally earn market victory with that. Well, now humans are the new hardware, and FB is approaching that model. 'Desperation' should be determined based on how closely FB mirrors MS's Moore's Law Model. That would presuppose artificial shaping of the market (something along the lines of eugenics-thinking).

<span style="color: #000000;">There will still be innovation, and that's what we will compete for.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I <a href="http://stuffaspergerpeoplelike.com/2008/10/15/24-dating-themselves/">date myself</a> constantly. Films, sleeping in with the Sun, long walks, al fresco dining, music shows, bike riding alone until 4AM, coffeeshopping until all the "regulars" leave, longboarding, monitoring music for hours, futball, going to the park, reading in public, people watching, playing with animals (I'm actually DJ Kitty Tummy Rub.), etc. Bear in mind these are all date material -- my ideal partner(/partners?) would enjoy grabbing nothing but a book and finding just about anywhere or anyway to read. Just about every morning begins with vocal stimming, and it's usually <em>easier </em>if someone else is available to provide an extra sound cue.

I once chased down two cyclists I thought would be ready to ride through the night, but she reached out her hand to embrace him, thus compelling me to realize that I had been doing this for years. I just get in the way of NTs who engage in activities for primarily social reasons.

Another time, after confessing interest in a friend, she, taken aback, informed me that she had to learn how to be alone. This was revealing to me, as it was something I could not at all understand. And I knew I couldn't understand it. I've had pretty severe training in learning to be alone, since grade school, throughout the "awkward years," and now, at times. Often, even in conversation, I feel alone as most others will dismiss my sharing of information about, say, the cure for cavities or SpaceX's real and actual progress. It's been happening for years, that I must endure conversations about bodily functions, sexual escapades, or how much work sucks. --

If I ever get trapped on a des(s)ert island, I should hope that at most I have my wits about me. It's not that I'm <em>lonely </em>but that by a certain time of the day, I'm <em>bored with myself</em>. Which is fair, usually by 3PM, I've read 5 scientific articles or concocted 5 web app ideas. I certainly have nothing to learn from people who are learning how to be alone. If anything, I'm a seasoned veteran at that -- should I call <em>this </em>insomnia, or simply my second wind?

My only problem is that <em>other social agents</em> is a special interest of mine; so, for instance, I absolutely enjoy finding other Aspies, or learning the approaches NTs et al take during talk exchanges. I suppose you could call it that: I have a special interest in talk exchanges. So, for instance, I once ran 5 miles with two NTs and gave a thorough exposition of Alain Badiou's mathematical ontology.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The theoretically important point is that classical physics, and the associated doctrine of materialism, fail to coherently explain self-directed neuroplastic phenomena, while the quantum mechanical principles that causally integrate mentalistic and physicalistic data clearly and explicitly do. Because experientially based language is not logically reducible to classical materialist terminology, yet such mentalistic language is a logical prerequisite for the design, execution, and description of volitionally directed neuroplastic phenomena, the attempt to explain such phenomena in solely materialist terms must be abandoned as a matter of principle: the logical structure of materialism is inadequate in these cases. In the light of the causal structure of quantum physics, as described in some detail in later sections of this article, the case for giving brain mechanisms a privileged position as the sole cause of our conscious efforts, and of their consequences, has become radically atheoretical and ungrounded in reason.

This show reminded me how sweet, warming, rock music can be, as deviant musicians not only play their instruments, but dearly extend sound, noise itself, with their innermost notions.

These artists make Houston absolutely essential. A madhouse of enchanting instrumentation from wholly charming cowpeople. They are crafting a sound, of folk to gypsy to saloon from dusty ballads, idle mental shaves, into simply noise primitivism. Are they playing music, or simply playing? I doubt it matters to these childlike yet seasoned musicians.

Throughout I felt as if I had been removed from the world, taken from my hometown, from the ordinary, and placed elsewhere. Somewhere near or far, or whenever, but certainly not home, not something conventional; yet though astonishingly I at the same moments found myself reminded, by their play, of all the things which make home being worth getting sick over. A strange feeling, which I doubt I can truly relate, if only to say that these musicians have reminded me of the beauty of live music, of musicians developing together.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I suppose it has come to this. Shirley? -- A previous draft precedes.

Where are we? In time, strato-politically speaking? What might describe an astronomical economy? To which other species, perhaps more intelligent than us, nevertheless are logically capable of adapting to a phenomenon, one such that it might be described by an economic force itself adaptable to the cosmic rigors of explored space.

A suspicion is this: such that features of human being need must adapt to the real force of machines. Most notably that force represents itself as an economic substrate to the natural constitution of beings unified in a fabric (@see blankets, DK) of ecologically present contexts. A grammar for machines is necessary, such that humans need not discover marginal concern for their well being. I say "need not" in a manner where the logical possibility of the incompatibility of their well being follows from any premise linked to the presentation of the well being of machines --

So what I'm saying is that some philosophers are selected for writing sacred texts. Why? When? Which texts? Who gives a fuck? Well -- It's sort of like: What's the last sentence?; Who knows? When do they know? What shapes the stuff of an internet ecology?

So I've taken a cup of water at a coffeeshoppe. Everybody seems to be okay with this. Whence cometh the incompatibility of freeganism? The determination of devaluation, an antagonism, of biodiversity? (( The Categories of a Hyperlexic. ))

<em>What can we do to them, yet what cannot be done us? -- </em>Like with CI, what is exposed is the presentation of the other. Its capabilities run the gamut against a multiplicity of structure. Gradually one must adapt to the extended abilities of machines.

Let us introduce a new feat: Stealth <a title="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/05/the-next-asia-is-africa-inside-the-continents-rapid-economic-growth/257441/ -- #houston #texas #austin #montrose #politics #notsuoh -- But these vi simulation extensions are buggers." href="http://www.d20resources.com/modern.d20.srd/skills/computer.use.php" target="_blank">Computing</a> --

Consider one premiss: A person uses a mobile device, and shares it. Any person thus can be triangulated simply by least resistant patterns describing geopolitical metadata. We touch these devices, and obviously there is a log of it. Who isn't using the device? Why would they use it? Under what conditions? IP addresses conceal only in virtue of being differentiated, not for that they are non-organic. Mapping humans to IP addresses is clearly a consideration.

I might call this a thoughthack. Thoughthacking. Do it.

There may come a time when reliable computer use determines, as opposed to economic placement, the registered knowledge of the individual. Where one goes on the web -- How one accessed it -- A network of keys.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Asperger's is calling a space. It's, like, a tyranny over metaphysical real estate, y'know?

To be frank, however, just _why_ are they so wierd? Awkward? What is this _evolutionarily novel advantage_? Mightn't it be that to secure personal security, woven into the fabric identity, aasimar from within express, in their constitution, a principle, perhaps a gene, of, in Heideggerian parlance, _withdrawal_?

Stimming exposes a tension. We are as tension opposed to tension. (( The Presentation of Boredom -- How well, or, to put it ever so prettily, richly might a species _express_ boredom? ))

_If one needs people, one is weak_. And how many times we have heard this before. Its transpositive being that strength entails solitude. A consolidation of pleasure principles wanes in the vertigo of human expectation.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Agents frequently take ad hoc digital photos, nearly immediately uploading them to the Internet. A social context may be developed, strictly speaking, from the count of those people statistically probable to occur at a geoeconomic point. Agents include within an ad hoc digital photo can be recognized and determine to move along predictable geoeconomic trajectories or paths, given time of day, time of week, special events, cultural sites, externally presented interests (web profiles, etc.). Any social circle may delimit maximally a geoeconomic environment, or community, strictly speaking, or planned economy. Using computer vision libraries, object and face determine may be used to develop possible ad hoc geoeconomic networks for which agents are weighted nodes. Consider human agents as nodes in a tag cloud; under any geoeconomic environment, an average of interest and economic potential from agents can be used to determine the momentum of economic force, from an agent at any given time. Each node may contextualize a sequence of terms, say in a tag cloud, given the substantive content for which the tags are members of the cloud. So, it seems that agents may similarly determine a range of economic force within a context. That force may be used to determine where and when those agents may transition from one context to another. Recording points of interaction between agent and context, or environment, involves the distribution of categorically similarly economic trajectories. Moreover, agents captured, unwittingly, in ad hoc records, or photos, imply an economic force of their peers, and so to, all together, an arrangement of their geoeconomic position, and thus approximated geographic positioning.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A material description is supported by the Standard Model, and largely Newtonian Physics. It describes the behavior of macroscopic bodies as subject to laws like Gravity and properties like gestalt mass. A physical description describes behavior and properties on which material behaviors and properties supervene; should physical descriptions invalidate or not support a material description, the question remains whether the physical description is more reliable than the material description. Self-directed neuroplasticity, a phenomenon discovered in cognitive-behavior therapy results, suggests that under certain experimental settings, experiential data is best explained (abductive reasoning) by physical description and theorizing. Physical descriptions, as evidenced by the prediction and successful isolation of the Higgs Boson, are compatible with quantum mechanical explanations, which supports a finer set of laws and observations and heuristics about the possible behavior of all bodies in the universe.

Many of my philosophical peers find it shocking that I should suggest that quantum mechanics has made its way into neuroscience. I find this incredibly laughable, that, namely, that I should be talking out of my ass. How many persons, old guards of experimental thought from prior generations, found themselves undermined because statistically their peers were not caught up, and thus they, themselves, become treated as if mad. -- What happened to truth being stranger than fiction? What happened to sincere dialectics?

As a Spinozist, I have long awaited for neuroscience to discover the reliability and veracity of the "field" as applied to the mind, where <em>the blush of the face</em>, similarly, does not describe a relation between <em>the blush</em> and <em>some face</em>, but rather a quality of the face. All the same, a particular object in space-time expresses a quality of its environment. Evolution clearly suggests this -- "If, during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life, organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organization [...]" (<a href="http://www.homodiscens.com/home/embodied/mortalis_astonishing/dangerous_algorithm/index.htm">Darin's Danger Algorithm</a>). So a quark or neuron, or what have you, may express a qualitylike behavior within its arrangements within a feature of certain reality. So, we might say that a jumping over a fence is a quality of the mode which sensibly describes all those reasons for which the jumping took place. Indeed, the jumping may not have happened, but <em>it did</em>, and probably would again.
<blockquote>From a scientific perspective the key issue here is determinism. Not all but almost all scientists believe that our minds are determined by physical changes in our brains and that if you knew enough, which they don't believe they do and few believe they will ever know enough, but if you knew enough you could tell what the brain state will be at time T1 by knowing what the brain state was at time T0 and what else happened in between. And from knowing that brain state, if you knew enough, you'd be able to deduce the mental state. And that all of our thoughts and actions in that sense are determined by the physical state of our brain which is determined by physical issues in the universe. That I think almost all neuroscientists believe.
<cite>Hank Greely, Law, Stanford</cite></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Structures of Silence Immanent in Intentional Spaces  </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For Spinoza, a redness of the face is a certain and determinate way a face can be. A face may become red for many reasons; however, blushing on the face indicates a certain and determinate way that the face is red. Like an analogy, <em>instantiated blushingness</em> excludes a range of certain and determinate ways for the face to be red. In similar fashion, a cat being in a room, or on a mat, indicates a certain and determinate way for the cat in its natural properties to be in arrangement <em>within a mode</em>. Certainly, the cat could not be on the ceiling. But its being on the mat excludes this, and more, it does inform us of the physical limitations, and thus viable physical conditions. Blushing indicates redness has opportunity. Being on the mat indicates particles have opportunity.

A colleague (M.W.) coined the notion <em>semantic silence</em>. I might call it a <em>semantic gap</em>. It seems amenable to semantic inertial fields, or something such; namely in that the natural lack of attention toward a concept or topic suggests a normative silence over that topic. Consciously, one may choose that torture should be undiscussable (R. Gaita). Moreover, a social system may lack any discussion, as a matter of natural fact, of their ultimate astro-political effects on nearby solar systems. -- Indeed, what are the ultimate astrological effects of a planet under ecological crisis? A more palpable example may be the ignorance surrounding Fair Trade co-ops both theirs, of the stock markets in NY and London, and consumers, of those commodity producers' matters of real concern (education, utilities development, of planned economies, etc.). The silence resembles the force of an audience to a death row inmate: silence engineers, or may engender, that to which attention should be directed. On the other hand, from mechanical, or natural, silence can one infer what is not a matter of real concern? Silence tells us what is not in thought, under some conditions. Under others, it directs, or functions as executive, to an intentional space. Might silence inform us of the semantic potential of an intentional space, over an agent or group of agents?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why Facebook Sucks</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Even those of you who use it to manage your Friendships, or your Business Contacts (
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ask yourself this: 13 year olds use Facebook to manage their social lives. Are you seriously arguing that as a marketer or business strategist, Facebook is your primary tool, the same tool that pre-teens and cam-whores use? <em>Really?</em></p>
). -- Mostly because <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/technology/silicon-valley-worries-about-addiction-to-devices.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;src=twr">Silicon Valley says step away from the device</a>? And <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/07/is-facebooks-ad-model-a-scam.html">is Facebook's ad model a scam</a>?

And its bogus advertising model that leaves our closest friends babbling about their sex lives rather than their creative endeavors. That Facebook compels, makes compulsory (<em>Did you see my post about how much I hate X?</em>), negative consumption: the consumption of Friends' consumption, rather than the consumption of Friend's production. For instance:

<em>Status Update:</em> "X made me feel bad."
<em>Comments:</em> "First!", "[meme response]", "<em>like</em>", etc.

All of that happens, of course, and ads are still soaring throughout all of that. Facebook is basing its model on the idea of someone interjecting "sound ads" throughout your socializing and conversing with people; it's advertising Tourette's. It's the empty feeling of not being able under follow a conversation at a bar because the music is too loud, or the football game, that feeling where it seems like the person with whom you are conversing continues to talk as if you are listening. <em>You know</em> that you are not listening, yet somehow this person is treating you as if you are. It engenders that high school cafeteria busybody feeling, all day long. --

It is stealing my friends, and is making most people I know more irritable, anxious, and bored. Isn't it just a <em>dating site</em>, anyway? Deep down?

<em>And it's built on PHP.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>The computer is being used in so many ways to extend our abilities, I can see no other possibility than to regard it as part of our extended phenotype.

[...]

The reason that humans have succeeded so well in comparison with many other life forms is the development of language, and therefore of memes that make us much more flexible in our ability to survive.

Particularly successful memes have caused paradigm shifts in human society, fueling the next generation of memes. Evidence shows that the rate of change of change has been increasing exponentially over hundreds of thousands of years.

Possibly within our lifetimes, we will be confronted with a very interesting time, when we may have to contend with seven new paradigms before breakfast every day.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Exponential curve not guaranteed; could simply be an S-curve. (a. if more bold, one might dare read as: a terrible generalization made by a few decades of silicon valley narcissistic/onanistic worship: or, play a round of "guess the continuous function" with only a finite number of plot points. b. indefinite exponential growth would demand (i) at least that reality is infinitely divisible, or (ii) that maximum entropy of a system could be overcome (aka (i) methodologically self-imposed epistemic limit, (ii) structural (ontic) limit.))


Furthermore, Stevey's phrase "extend our abilities" requires either an (1) ethical or (2) biological caveat ((1) being defensible either by a collectivist or transhumanist interpretation, (2) being favorable if one ignores the effects on the hippocampus. And in general if one ignores the internet as we know it as a literal (read, "physical") reconfiguring of the reward systems and neural connections (via neuroplasticity) of the brain by the profit margins of Google (who makes more money as the number of ads per unit of time increases (e.g. free internet and project glass)). 


I don't want to go overboard as I drifted from the abstract to the more specialized, and as we know that's always a philosophic faux pas. ]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Capital: The only way a philosopher can make a living off of one’s practical philosophy, is to modernize acceptance of pain for everyone, which requires the marketable experience of pain itself. Modernization is a concept within gestalt psychology which outlines a set of methodologies for describing pain felt by any expression of existence. Those being organic, digital, mechanical (material). In a way, I’m attempting to one up Daniel Dennett’s _intentional stance_, which more or less does the same thing; however, such a position on phenomenological being antedates his philosophical methodology in that it posits the rejection of lost epiphenomenal data, and grants it causal force by describing it under a quantum mechanical conceptual scheme. Phenomenology may even grant the truth of epiphenomenalism, in that psychological events do not intercept the natural, or mechanical, causal chain of events, and even further that psychophysical laws themselves do not exist. However, those events whereby interaction might occur do not lack description, but only the posit of real causal force. A total picture of reality would not defeat the counterfactual situation of that description’s content. But rather culminate the essential rules necessary to produce anything called a total picture. This should not show that the psychological laws do not possess real causal force, but only that the laws may be described multiply.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What I find interesting is perhaps an "efficiency rate of truth."

So, for instance, news media has, let's say, an obligation to ensure
that further evidence on a news thread won't entirely invalidate
previous reports or disclosure. So, one might say

that the news media is expected to produce a certain quality and quantity
of truth within a certain time after event, E, but further truths discovered
may negatively affect the overall perceived veracity of newer reports.

Perhaps another way to put it is that the onus in on a news source
to be consistent with itself and its own evidence in the face of a time crunch;

this all generally influences the overall rate of efficiency of truth
towards integration into an established belief economy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre>You all, on islands of various size,
ripe with exotic nectar and marvelous
flora, sun bright songbirds of selcouth
melodies, some with shady groves and
gentle streams, others with sandy pits, and
caverns full of shiny things, shorelines
defended by legions of scuttling crabs,
pacific beachfront dappled with the shadows
of drifting dreaming bands of nimbus
clouds, must understand it is difficult
for me to get out to you, for I possess
but the humblest of boats, which to
all appearances has more in common
with a dowsing rod. It shudders like a leaf
at every passing breeze and offers no protection
from the shadows of the sea, which might
be as benign as a flying fish,
as gentle as a sea-turtle, or garrulous
like a pod of wayfaring dolphins
who stop to chat and pirouette a bit,
or icy cold as the terrifying
recognition of a razor-toothed
emissary of pelagic death.</pre>
<pre>I'd want that you should know, when I can I cast
out bottles containing messages.
If this one should reach you, know I care
about you, whomever you are, and I am
preparing, always struggling, like a nervous
tick, my mind, voice and heart, the various
accoutrements of the soul, so when
next we meet, or drift idly in those placid
currents (who are the gentle progeny of 
those multipotent tides on which, in the old days,
we worked the fearsome ship's ponderous oars
through the savage saltsea crests beneath
the violet and blood red cumulonimbus,
grand and terrifying as the gods,
prone to thunderous displays of primeval
strength, though we in our brave array flinched not
but worked the mast, defended the sails, and held
steady our course), we can share a song, or think
while carousing or daydreaming over drink.</pre>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Urgent: The Failure of Facebook</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>Like other “social” apps (cough eVite cough), Facebook has all the social graces of a nose-picking, hyperactive six-year-old, standing at the threshold of your attention and chanting, “I know something, I know something, I know something, won’t tell you what it is!”
-- <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=bot;idno=5283331.0003.001;rgn=div1;view=text;cc=bot;xc=1;g=dculture;node=5283331.0003.001%3A8"><cite>How Your Creepy Ex-Co-Workers Will Kill Facebook</cite></a></blockquote>
<h2>Social Network Mismanagement</h2>
Someone once made the counterpoint to me: "Facebook allows for me to manage my social network." It's not clear to me, but when <em>software</em> allows for anyone, ranging from nuisance to acquaintance, that is, anyone under the sun, even date terrorists and under-radar sex-addicts, to demand "Friend me on Facebook (now)!", it seems something horribly wrong has emerged in my social world, generally. How can I possibly have the social orientation, the gusto, and stamina to take on and defend against the fray of in-real-life "Friend Requests"? Cory Doctorow puts this sentiment perfectly:
<blockquote>The fact that she doesn’t like her boss doesn’t really matter: in the social world of Friendster and its progeny, it’s perfectly valid to demand to be “friended” in an explicit fashion that most of us left behind in the fourth grade.</blockquote>
Indeed. Quite fucking indeed, and fuck you; fuck you and your friend request. I am not a child; I am an adult; what have you said that actually warrants the opportunity to sleuth and investigate my social world? -- and what's more, to color these thoughts with a bit of reverse sexism, or unjustified, speech-into-nothingness, unprompt'd sexy valor and all that: Women. Women, women, women.

"Give me your number!" has replaced the finishing school desperate dater's dialogue with "What's your Facebook?" It's an implied threat to "friend"; and subsequently, disclose infinitely more than any number could disclose. Would you give your number to some random stranger? Is it "safer," a more defensive strategy to give out your Facebook instead? Did you really think that offer of your Facebook profile through? -- In some states, they use Facebook IDs to allow entrance into bars and so forth. All the frightening concerns apply: Will this bar now track me? Deny me when I "check-in" at the competition? What, ultimately, is it that they are after?: One consideration is <em>your timeline</em>. At the end of the day, how many stalkers have you accrued?

Again. <em>I </em>manage my social network; not some automated personal data collection monolithic network. My friends are those who strive to extract from me genuine experiences, not stalkers who <em>anticipate me</em> or predict my next utterance by virtue of a unacademic psychologizing of my status updates. Again. Fuck you:
<blockquote>You’d think that Facebook would be the perfect tool for handling all this. It’s not. For every long-lost chum who reaches out to me on Facebook, there’s a guy who beat me up on a weekly basis through the whole seventh grade but now wants to be my buddy; or the crazy person who was fun in college but is now kind of sad; or the creepy ex-co-worker who I’d cross the street to avoid but who now wants to know, “Am I your friend?” yes or no, this instant, please.</blockquote>
<h2>Be a Real Friend</h2>
Stop cheating, and learn how to be a real friend. Delete your fucking Facebook. <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/02/fake-facebook-accounts/">83 million plus</a> of those users aren't real anyway.
<blockquote>Mr. Crabb, the Facebook executive, said his primary concern was that people live balanced lives. At the same time, he acknowledges that the message can run counter to Facebook’s business model, which encourages people to spend more time online. “I see the paradox,” he said.
-- <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/technology/silicon-valley-worries-about-addiction-to-devices.html"><cite>Silicon Valley Says Step Away From the Device</cite></a></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>[...] a fixed, self-enclosed social system but rather a definite trend in the historic development of mankind, which, in contrast with the intellectual guardianship of all clerical and governmental institutions, strives for the free unhindered unfolding of all the individual and social forces in life. Even freedom is only a relative, not an absolute concept, since it tends constantly to become broader and to affect wider circles in more manifold ways. For the anarchist, freedom is not an abstract philosophical concept, but the vital concrete possibility for every human being to bring to full development all the powers, capacities, and talents with which nature has endowed him, and turn them to social account. The less this natural development of man is influenced by ecclesiastical or political guardianship, the more efficient and harmonious will human personality become, the more will it become the measure of the intellectual culture of the society in which it has grown.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Forgive the length, and the time we are both wasting.



What is the nature of this "social account"? An averaging function of some abstract concept of humanity, which regards its members as interchangeable and measures efficiency in place of human qualities? Is our goal to minimize the amount of injustice that occurs? Then we should have to make everything illegal! Does it not also assume the premise that each individual not only knows what's best for oneself but also knows this better than anyone else could? Surely the addiction-prone tendencies of certain people should be considered.     Plus what justifies the libertarian notion that if people were left to their own devices it would work out best for everyone? Is this a divinely sanctioned truth, or did evolution stumble upon it? Does it not suppose a certain amount of indoctrination before we can consider someone a capable human being who can make rational decisions?  If people were left to their own devices, we would have warrior led societies again, unless we are in a sufficiently post-scarcity society, which simply means we would have achieved digital feudalism and have affected a reduction of the worth of a person to nothing more than caring about their own pleasure.
And by either some libertarian philosophic magic, or the magic of the machine, all of that works to benefit the system, aka "humanity" (a concept which already requires sufficient machine technology).  Certainly, one can apply the efficiency principle to man, it's just a physical truth that evolution didn't get it entirely right. Perhaps the progeny of a small subset of our brains will function more efficiently. But that's still all abstract mumbo jumbo. What's the psychological effect of thinking that way? Why should I care if future efficiency is better, if it means obliterating my memory, in a blind attempt to increase information rates? A goal always beyond now, since, in physical terms, efficiency can always improve, and by so improving it rapes and pillages all the modes of life along the way, to make it to the masturbatory theoretic endpoint. The shared delusions of a conquered people, worshiping an infant god? Their very lives sacrificed, the fecundity of time slashed and burned to produce the crops of efficiency? The 19th century still thought that each person was a courtly gentleman, who, if not imposed on by the will of unjust power structures (at this time both church and state had been sufficiently bureaucratized through industrialization he would be polite and studious, so would be enlightened enough to make the right decision, for the sake of the social account. 
One must always measure the psychological effects! man's drives where selected for over a long period of time and to radically change the environment, the intimate form of relationships (I'm talking intra-culturally even!), will have immense psychological effects, which could very greatly. One such radical environmental change is  the rate at which information can spread (until the 19th century the fastest information could spread was at the rate a horse can travel over land). Another change is world population. Both of these changes caused the notion of "humanity" to appear more legitimate, though at the same time domestic, or proximal life was being eviserated, so we moved from a face to face conception of people to one based on secondary and tertiary feedback and compilation through statistics, news headlines, cynical novels, mass media, yada yada; all of this has psychological effects and the more a person is concerned only with necessary conditions of existence (eat poop orgasm pee), and the more the person is a coward who functions reflexively to avoid being startled, or to escape thoughts of death, the more comfortable they are in a cage, so long as their caretakers feeds them.]]></wp:comment_content>

<hr />

<blockquote>¶ Throughout slavery’s history, white women have been held up on a pedestal, deemed virtually untouchable to black men. During slavery, and for many decades after its abolition, the punishments dealt to an African-American man who had sexual relations with a white woman (whether consensual or not) were strict and extremely violent, often ending in a lynching focused on stripping the accused of his masculinity. Thus, it is possible to see how anxieties about such penalties could create in the minds of black men an impression of white women involving a strange mix of hate and desire.
¶ Such a combination of conflicted emotions is prevalent in the Battle Royal when the young fighters are put face-to-face with a naked white stripper. At such a sight, the protagonist recalls, “I tried to back away, but they were behind me and around me. Some of the boys stood with lowered heads, trembling. I felt a wave of irrational guilt and fear. …Yet I was strongly attracted and looked in spite of myself.” Furthermore, he says, “I felt a desire to spit upon her as my eyes brushed slowly over her body” (19). He describes similar reactions in the others saying, “Another boy began to plead to go home…wearing dark red fighting trunks too small to conceal his erection…He tried to hide himself with his boxing gloves” (20). With this the protagonist calls attention to the shame associated with such a desire. And this shame is not just a reaction to the scene at hand, but part of a whole “historical consciousness” (Clinton, 212), formed by the institution of slavery and reinforced by the yells of the white spectators. “Some threatened us if we looked and others if we did not,” remembers the protagonist (20). The ambivalence of this chant carries with it an inherent pleasure for the spectators, as it uses the sexuality of the young men against them in an irrational test of both their fear and masculinity.
¶ This test uses sexual humiliation in order to bring these men down to an emasculated state so they might welcome the upcoming fight as a way to restore their dignity. Before this occurs, however, the white spectators begin harassing the white dancer. “They caught her just as she reached the door, raised her from the floor, and tossed her as college boys are tossed at hazing,” describes the protagonist. Watching this happen, however, he relates it to his own experience just a moment before. He says, “Above her red, fixed-smiling lips I saw the terror and disgust in her eyes, almost like my own terror and that which I saw in some of the other boys” (20). Where she is one moment the source of their guilt and fear, this blonde white woman suddenly finds herself sharing in the humiliation of these young black men. She is held at a distance from them, and yet they are all subjected to the same exploitation for the pleasure of the spectators.

Why "blacks on blondes" is a thing. I cannot make this shit up. Quick, let's cover it up with another linguistic diversion. -- Off yourself.

"Why is he so worked up about the man?"; "Hung up on white women?" "Jungle fever!" And all the recursive social grammars for reconstituting racism through language, art, music and watercooler conversation. -- Listen, go read a fucking book on the history of a America. Just about ever other trope or meme is a fucking slap in the face, as ignorant prick swill peruse the bars for an easy fuck, against all odds, come what may, despite the most recent blow to the head. That is, a book that you had to find yourself; not one that was spoon-fed to you by a university or your deranged psychotropic grandmother.

And stop thinking that because you have an opinion, it's at once some kind of valid rebuttal. You do not know what you are talking about because you are undereducated. You do not. Stop talking. Or maybe <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/bob-dylan-slavery_n_1876623.html">listen to Bob Dylan</a>.

How is anyone expected to love in this country? Where our historical backdrop, so soon ago, influences every dating scene to the T. Women hunting for drug dealers with few strings attached, and Bob Marleys on every street corner. -- Is Obama's Presidency really just a existentially grand "too soon" joke? At the cost of how many infinitums of folks down the thread of history, into our technofuture? And so on. (Is Obama's Presidency, that is, a "scenario" or "disaster situation" a la Nick Bostrom et al? -- How soon "after slavery" is an arguable range of "too soon" or "you must be kidding?" or "Is this a joke?" -- Look'it how fixated our Big Media is on race. And that every black guy with dreadlocks must be rasta. -- Each day I am, at least once, robbed of my identity simply on account of a hair style that occurs <em>naturally</em>. Dreadlocks I have very little say or control over, have somehow given me a form of transcendence. <em>Great.</em> "It happens all the time. People are stupid." -- No, fucking stop. How often are <em>you</em> assumed to be a Jew or Christian simply on account of your <em>hairstyle</em>? (( And bear in mind, I'm a Strict Atheist. I am the farthest removed from even tolerance of Judeo-Christian thought. I am <em>Hostile </em>to orthodox theistic thought. )) Stop fucking talking and blabbering and answer the question --)

Why -- any of this? Because I'm getting sick of people interrupting me when I try to work, under the sun and clouds and near the divinely trees, just to remind me that my work is either:

1. Boring
2. Academic
3. "Nerdy"

Fuck you.

Why -- any of this? Because anyone without a right mind would, in an attempt to console me, argue with me that when some Anglo-American ex-junky maintenance worker for brothel apartment complex didn't <em>really</em> mean to shout out "Boy!" as if it were my name. From the street. Twice. Or the old grunge-punker guy who asks my close-friend, after just meeting and while greeting a female friend: "Is this your woman?"

People are petting me, and calling me "Boy." Why? Because I'm wearing cutoffs like every other lanky "hipster"?

What is the connection? We see the thread of history. Many entertain the idea that racism is over, but in truth, it has only become thicker while entrenched in news media garbage and the melting pot swill that is American culture. It is not that racism is over: People are too mentally handicapped, such that everything becomes permitted. Most of these people cannot remember yesterday since the beginning of the "f"-twitch that goes off whenever they are at a keyboard. Or the jittery phantom phone jig. These people are so exhausted from their own inability to think and live happily, that they feel their lack of vitality, like a sick person, allows for them to say and do whatever they please.

Men call other men boys whom they feel are not their competition, in any way, and more specifically, in the dating game. Women spill their hearts out into boys, as if they were their children. Each day I see nothing but "fear and masculinity."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This country is on fire.

I have not watched television in nearly 2 years. I feel like I just stepped out of a fucking time machine, into a dystopian future. I am not fucking kidding you. And I'm expected to conform? Are you fucking kidding me?
<div style="padding: 4px;">

</div>
<span style="font-size: xx-large;">OMG @ <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/30/jon-stewart-rips-rnc-we-built-it_n_1842598.html">this country</a>.</span>

You mean to tell me while Bitcoin exchanges worth $250,000 are getting <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.net/bitfloor-hacked-250000-missing/">hacked</a>, and while bank systems are getting <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/story/12/08/26/207241/hackers-dump-millions-of-records-from-banks-politicians">pwned</a> for millions of accounts, we're not all expected to be flipping shit right now? And while THIS is our entertainment media? Where we continue to pay (<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/36285557/How-to-Steal-Food-From-the-Supermarket-Loom-Panics">taxed groceries</a>, 34 million tons of <a href="http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/08/totally-green-launches-new-food-waste-recycling-program/">food waste</a>, taxed <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-First-for-Udacity-Transfer/134162/">education</a>, war tax, <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/researchers-expose-location-of-pirate-bay-uploaders-120831/">academic attacks</a> on filesharing, and soon: <a href="http://www.thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/245479-fcc-eyes-tax-on-internet-service">taxed Internet</a>; with <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/08/whats-wrong-tpp">N-strikes policies</a>, lack of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2012/07/31/death-of-a-sci-fi-dream-free-floating-space-colonies-hit-economic-reality/">spaceward-consciousness</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act">war</a> on <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02012/jul/31/coming-century-war-against-your-computer/">computing</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/immune-disorders-and-autism.html?_r=1">overurbanization</a>, along with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/technology/silicon-valley-worries-about-addiction-to-devices.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;src=twr">neurotax</a> of Facebook; the <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/12/08/04/1458217/mathematician-predicts-wave-of-violence-in-2020">wave of violence</a>, etc.)?

That we are to continue to roll on as if we are not establishing an economic baseline for gross-budget nonsense like the Republican National Convention? And all the rest of this? -- Perhaps my implied message is in itself ethically suspect: but in truth, what the fuck? Why isn't anyone listening?

Look: RNC has built a campaign ("We built it") based on not being generous, or forgiving, towards this current President's speech patterns; his façon de parler. "Taking out of context" and "failing to follow a foreigner" are two totally fucking different issues.

<em>Fuck you.</em> That is racism.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How To: Use Facebook</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook attempts to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/25/5-design-tricks-facebook-uses-to-affect-your-privacy-decisions/">design away</a> your privacy. This shouldn't be news; your intuition is right. What is it about the Facebook interface that engenders web surfer loyalty? Do you truly find it a convenience app? Or is it a convenience of habit? Is "managing my social network" a matter of me manually interacting with streams by streams of the world itself responding to my virtual and physical existence? Facebook gives one the opportunity to perceive their own virtual presence, but what in the order of "response" does Facebook enable? Should I find myself, daily, perpetually, conducting impromptu digital rap sessions with every chitter-chatter in my status stream? Or my chat? What more could this app do for me, other than proffer a "virtual-out" from reality. How is it managing anything? It's not, in and of itself, doing anything for me; it's <em>providing for</em> me. The name fits: imagine a high school year book, from the future of course, that "organically updates" throughout the years. For instance, each Name label for each student automagically appears in the current hand-writing style of each student, decades upon decades down the line into the future. How useful is this <em>kind</em> of information to you? What can you do with it?

It is instant nostalgia. Do you recall that guilty feeling after successfully circumventing another 2-hour long snoozefest with your grandmother, where you both, for the 3rd time that month, painstakingly browse the family photo album? -- That is it. What is grandmother after? Why does she need to share in this way? What is the practice of dying? Is the photo album doing anything in particular, or is it simply being acted upon? Flipped through; commented on, where the comments take you --

But how about this. Place your family photo album at the entrance of a busy restaurant. Or sneak it into doctor's office. What comes of this? Who is affected? What relationship has one developed from finding that album in exactly the place hidden?

I have what I am calling a "Community Facebook" account. The password is "123456"; e-mail: "nerdfiles@gmail.com". My actual computers have <code>hosts</code> files which point to <code>127.0.0.1</code>. When web pages call <code title="Or www.facebook.com">facebook.com</code>, nothing happens. I do not wish to have blogs and Web networks like CBS or CNN, or what have you, identify my machine as a Facebook user simply on account of the fact that I have an account, and I am currently logged in. I do not want for CBS, for instance, to know that I am a Facebook user simply because I have entered their site. This is equivalent to a store knowing which credit card I use simply on account that I have window shopped by them.

Ideally, a social networking receptacle, which is what Facebook is, should provide content to your interests, but the actual acting upon that content, in Facebook's hands, in your hands, involves a painstaking effort at physically, personally, etc., hand-tuning a machine. Imagine having constantly to adjust or maintain your car's alignment as you drive it. Imagine building the Ship of Theseus as it floats you across the Aegean. How taxing is such a practice.

Whereas one could <a href="http://ifttt.com">implement actions</a> over the wealth of their interests (that is, exploring your interests). These actions are automated. And they might inform others of your true identity and character. And in truth, what good is my saying that I like something? A "like", in truth, is an independent discovery, and it should be coincidence that others like it. No one should be forced to the prompt, "Do you like this?" Imagine the question in everyday conversation. Undoubtedly it is intrusive and mildly authoritarian. It's almost a demand: "Do you like me?"

Automated actions over the web ensure that when we find pleasure in things, we are cooperating in our discoveries because we are focused on our interests, and not our powers to persuade or coerce. Our pleasure should emerge naturally out of our quest for information.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Diets that ignore lifestyle are greedy. How about a new term? "Ethnodiet," or "technediet" rather than "logodiet" or "science-based diet."

"Food hacking"; or the hacking of one's self through molecular gastronomy, presupposes a set of ethnonutritional axioms which require expression in the language of its imperatives. Those imperatives are not manifestly given in the realist statements of the effects of foodstuffs on the human organism. One is not hacking oneself if one blindly obeys the "truth" of nature; there is no creativity expressed in obeying what is perceived to be a maximal law; hacking involves a persistent belief in circumvention. How can one hack food if its existence can be talked about in a fully deterministic way? -- This is the approach of standard "nutrition" theories.

The philosophy of "food hacking" might be labeled "mereological gastronomy."
<h2>What kind of science</h2>
Regardless of the authority of scientists, or nutritionists, you are probably not one. Whereas appealing to the authority of astronomists may be an epistemtically defensible practice, appealing to the authority of nutritionists may not be. The discoveries of astrophysics arguably have direct influence on your life, but if they do, we'd be hard-pressed to integrate those findings in our everyday lives; the discoveries of nutrition, oddly researchers and laypeople alike, seem to carry an inherent imperative as to what-comes-next after said discovery is made. Whatever the content of the discovery, the "what-comes-next" is a matter of decision, but at the same point, it is a decision of whether the discovery is amenable to all of food science or not.

In astrophysics, for instance, we have a long-standing set of metarules for the integration and change of the overall conceptual system. Where is this in food science? And what is more, Does a scientist's finding in and of themselves say anything about normative structure? (This idea is from Alain Badiou: "Situations are nothing more in their being than pure multiplicity. Nothing normative can be drawn from the simple realist's observation of the becoming of things.")
<h2>"In Defense of Food"</h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Eat Food</strong>
<em>that could be readily identified by most traditional cultures; no Food Disputes; don't eat foodlike substances</em>;</li>
	<li><strong>Mostly Plants</strong> --
<em>they have the most mature survival systems, eat them</em>;</li>
	<li><strong>Not Too Much</strong>
<em>learn how to eat little; that is, learn austerity, not asceticism; apply more traditional diets as this doubly expresses a political note and expresses Occam's Razor which does not aim to lose weight, but return one's body to an earlier state of humans within "civilization"</em></li>
</ol>
"Science-based diets" tend to lack consciousness of the ethnological structures we must persist within. A diet that says {nothing} about the contextualized features of Eating is blind. -- Something like what Einstein said.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[wait. what? rule 2 does not follow sound logic, if the fact that they have the most mature survival systems is used as an argument for the conclusion that we should eat mostly plants. (I really doubt you are attempting to present it as such: because computers are also better at storing certain types of information, therefore we should eat them. We don't siphon the powers of systems we eat (otherwise I'd eat the brains of geniuses))


I think an argument that uses the logic of evolutionary biology would favor a paleolithic diet (which attained 64-68% of its calories from animal sources, due to their typically denser protein and caloric content), as agriculture is still relatively a young mutation that has laid nowhere near a majority claim on the human genotype.


but anyway, just food for thought. personally, i'm sick of living like a cyborg, everything always spliced and sliced up on the cartesian grid, everything a function of efficiency. perhaps it's inevitable, but then again so is my demise.  ]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I was a bit careless with 2. The gist I have here is that we often revel in the thought of common roaches survival a nuclear disaster scenario. Likely, I believe, any form of vegetation would survive, in the broadest sense. Ultimately we should base our diet, a subprocess of our survivability, on those ingredients most probably capable of extended survival throughout any disaster scenario. In a sense, the idea is to learn from the wisest member of any species possible of existing on a given planet. This is both a biological-normative claim and pragmatic claim at once; our subsystems may learn best from those species most capable of survival, and our ecological epistemology (normative pragmatic) requires ethos attain sensitivity to, let's say, an emergent wisdom quotient that is embedded in the brute facts of survival of a long-lasting embedded species. Ideally what this means is: "birds of a feather" in terms of naive survival. I'd like to institute a movement of naivism: the embrace of multiply realized realities under the pretense of trust.

Perhaps I am thinking of [mock] resistentialism, where one is implored to view the phenomenological experience of inanimate objects as, pragmatically, for all intents and purposes, "out to get us." No matter the structure of experience, the lack of intentionality entails the probability of an object's bringing about of one's ruin. This is tin-foil-hatism, indeed, but with the array of pianos which topple grandmothers and every-variable-so-determines car accidents, and with the chances of ever-dreaming or anything science {may} say, a wanton embrace of the maximal good of all objects seems a toss up. Perhaps it is.

In a way, the statements of science postulate "sciense"; the common sense of science, that which should be obeyed as good sense in one's ethnologically holistic experience. Any statement of science, including statistical probabilities, either do or do not fall within the scope of "sciense." I'm suggesting that if they do, they tell us that statistically, we should fear analyzed reality on top of the whole of nature as an existential limiting point. If they do not, we possess a set of statistical probability statements degrees remove from every experience. But then what should direct everyday experience? I'm suggesting a robust model-descriptive approach to reality acceptance; discover and embrace, and this is all.

Bit of distractions around. Losing lucidity... I should hope these rambling carry any weight, if only as insight to my mania.]]></wp:comment_content>
